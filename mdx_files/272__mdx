# RTE - KX Delta Platform

Original URL: https://code.kx.com/platform/stream/rte_template/

# DS_RTE

The _Real-time Engine (RTE)_ process subscribes to another process and
receives streaming data from that process. It is configured to process the
streaming data in a particular manner. It is generally configured to subscribe
to specific tables and run high computational calculations, as specified by
the realTimeMsgFunct analytic parameter, on these tables.

Typical use cases for an RTE process would include a PnL Engine or an RTE
calculating and publishing enriched data such as vwap, moving averages etc.
The RTE can also be configured to publish information sometimes directly to
another Process within the framework or back to a Tickerplant so that other
process instances can subscribe to any enrichment it does.
