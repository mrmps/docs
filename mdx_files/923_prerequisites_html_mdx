# Prerequisites

## License

A valid license is provided on each marketplace.

For more information on non-marketplace implementations please contact
licadmin@kx.com.

Once a license file has been obtained, it may either be a `kc.lic` or a
`k4.lic` file. A number of the examples for Microservices deployments require
the contents of these files to be set as environment variables. For `kc.lic`
licenses, `KDB_LICENSE_B64` needs to be set to the [base
64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) encoded content. If `k4.lic` is
used, `KDB_K4LICENSE_B64` needs to used instead. Only one of these environment
variables is required.

## System

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed and running â€“ the `docker` command
should work inside the development environment. Also

## Module-specific

QPacker itself has no dependencies, but to use it you will need an account
with a cloud provider.
