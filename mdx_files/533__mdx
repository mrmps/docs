# Websockets

Websockets are web protocols that allow clients and servers to communicate bi-
directionally in realtime over a persistent TCP connection. All messages sent
across a WebSocket connection are asynchronous.

## Async call via websockets

  * Take the code from the appendix and create two files in the same directory: 

[Websocket code](../dw_qr_ws_appendix/)

Within the _HTML_ code, it takes user input, opens a handle to the `kxw_qr_gw`
service and executes the `.mon.getMemWS` analytic with the input parameters.

  * In `getMemWS.html`, change the host and port tailored to your environment. The port should be addressing a running `kxw_qr_gw` process.

    
    
    ws = new WebSocket("ws://HOST:PORT/");
    

  * Open the `getMemWS.html` on a browser. 

  * _Right-click > Inspect > Console_. If a connection is successfully made, these should be printed to your console:

  * Change the parameter values and hit _submit_. Results should be returned as a table on screen.
