# KX Delta Platform user interface

With the deploy running you should now be able to connect to the webserver
using your browser.

The Web _KX Control_ interface was introduced in KX Delta Platform Version
4.0.0 and replaces the previous Eclipse Desktop UI.

The _KX Delta Platform_ web applications can be accessed via your browser, the
address is the hostname of your WebServer deploy and the HTTP port of the
deploy. e.g.

    
    
    http://web-a.fd.com:8080/
    

Upon loading the page you should see the following links:

should be changed on first login.
