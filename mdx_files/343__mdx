# Publish and Export

Once a dashboard is saved and published, anyone with the appropriate
permission can view or edit it.

A screenshot of a dashboard can be taken using the PDF button:

## Publish Dashboards

New dashboards are published by checking the box to the right of the Name; to
convert a dashboard into draft form, uncheck this selection.

Draft dashboards are prefixed 'Draft' in the [Document
List](../workspace/#document-list). Draft dashboards are not visible in the
_Viewer_.

Draft dashboards will show in the Manage dialog with no selection check; click
the check to publish the dashboard. The Manage dialog is accessible at the end
of the Document List.
