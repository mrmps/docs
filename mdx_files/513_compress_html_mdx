The compression algorithm to be used when compressing a DB partition/column.

Presently the supported algorithms are qipc, gzip, snappy, lz4hc and zstd.
These algorithms support different compression levels denoting the
agressivness of compression in each case.

algorithm | levels  
---|---  
none | 0  
q IPC | 0  
gzip | 0-9  
snappy | 0  
lz4hc | 0-16  
zstd | -7-22
