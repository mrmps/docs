openssl-libs-1.0.2k-12.el7.x86_64 | libssl.so.1.0.2k  
RHEL 8.0+ | openssl-1.1.1c-2.el8_1.1.x86_64  
openssl-libs-1.1.1c-2.el8_1.1.x86_64 | libssl.so.1.1  
UBUNTU 18+ | 1.1.0g-2ubuntu4.3 | libssl.so.1.1  
UBUNTU 20+ | 1.1.1f-1ubuntu2 | libssl.so.1.1  
  
To be able to use LDAP authentication to _KX Control_ , `openldap` is required
to be installed on the host server.

OpenLDAP | RPM/PKG | Library  
---|---|---  
RHEL 7.0+ | openldap-2.4.44-15.el7_5.x86_64 | libldap-2.4.so.2.10.7  
RHEL 8.0+ | openldap-2.4.46-11.el8_1.x86_64 | libldap-2.4.so.2.10.9  
UBUNTU 18+ | 2.4.45+dfsg-1ubuntu1.2 | libldap_r-2.4.so.2.10.8

## Third party software

### Java runtime environment

Supported versions:

### PDF viewer

_KX Dashboards_ provide the ability to convert a dashboard in a web browser to
a PDF. In order to do this you need to have the following installed on your
deploy host.

  * Nodejs 8.11.1+
  * Google Chrome 65.0.3325.181+

## Host configuration

Kdb+ licenses (`k4.lic`) are tied to the hostname of a machine and
specifically the hostname in FQDN (`<HOSTNAME>.<DOMAINNAME>`) format. When run
on a machine which is incorrectly configured you will get a `host` error when
running the `q` binary.

For more information on kdb+ license errors see
[code.kx.com](https://code.kx.com/q/basics/errors/#license-errors)

In order for kdb+ to run, the hostname in the license file must be present as
an alias to a network interface in the `/etc/hosts` file on the box. The
network interface aliased will be used for inter process communication so it
must be one which is accessible by all hosts wishing to connect to the system.
The format of the entry in `/etc/hosts` should be as follows:

    
    
    <IP ADDRESS> <FQDN> <HOSTNAME>
    

For example if a host with IP address `10.190.1.232` is called `kdbdev` and is
on the `firstderivatives.com` domain then the `/etc/hosts` file should look
like this:

    
    
    10.111.1.222 kdbdev.firstderivatives.com kdbdev
