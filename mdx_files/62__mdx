# Layout Panel

![Screenshot](../img/layout/layoutpanel.jpg)

Layout panels are used to nest components within the dashboard, and are best
used within [Flex Panel](../flexpanel/), [Tab Control](../tabcontrol/) and
[Accordion](../accordion/) components or to create elements like navigation
menus.

## Basics

_Name_

    A name for the component provided by the user. 
_Fill Height_

    

When checked, autosizes nested components to fill the height of the Layout
panel.

Tip

Enable after adding all required components to the panel

_Advanced Layout_

    

Best-fit component according to panel width; components stack on resizing.
Positioning components with _Advanced Layout_ requires CSS.

_Fill Height_ versus _Advanced Layout_

_Fill Height_ auto scales components to browser height. _Advanced Layout_
requires CSS to position components. If both are enabled, only _Advanced
Layout_ rules will apply.

_User Layout_

    User arrangement of components; add, remove and reposition. 

  1. Enable User Layout. In `View on Web` mode (or "Quickview") the customization icon will be visible

  2. Once enabled components will become movable and can be repositioned

  3. Components can be deleted

  4. Removed (and hidden) components can be returned (or included) by clicking on the Component Layout button and selecting them from the list. Components are identified by their title, user-defined name or component type, and in that order of preference. Clicking on 'Reset Layout' will restore the layout of the components to their original state.

  5. Once complete, click the settings icon

  6. Save layout

_Floatable_

    When enabled, an added component will snap to nearest row anchor. Otherwise, component will always snap to top row. 
_Enable WebGL Context_

    When enabled, every ChartGL widget that is directly added to the Layout Panel will share a single WebGL context.
_Column Count_

_Row Count_ / _Row Height_

    

Define Layout grid size. Components added are locked in position to this grid.
The grid is visible when a component is dragged into position.

Row Height

If _Fill Height_ is disabled, _Row Count_ becomes _Row Height_. _Row Height_
is the height in pixels between each grid row. The number of grid rows used is
defined by the prior _Row Count_ value; e.g. if _Row Count_ is 30 and _Row
Height_ is set to 30; then the distance from top to bottom - in the absence of
_Fill Height_ \- is 900 pixels; i.e 30 x 30. If the pixel height is greater
than the browser height, a scroll bar will appear and some components may be
positioned off-screen.

### Using Layout Panel

  1. Add a Flex Panel, Accordion or Tab Control component

  2. Left-click-and-drag in a Layout panel

  3. Add a component to the Layout panel; this will fill the area of the Layout panel, but can be resized to add additional components.

Check both

Unless you have a reason to lock the size of components dropped into a Layout
panel, check both _Fill Height_ and _Advanced Layout_. This ensures the
components in your Layout panel autosize along with the Accordion or Tab
Control section that contains it.

Using Advanced Layout CSS

CSS can be used to position components and use fixed-sizing to prevent
component resizing on changes in browser width. Use `.advanced-item[data-
widgetid="xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx"] {}` to configure Advanced Layout CSS
