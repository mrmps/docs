# Machine Learning Toolkit - KX Delta Platform

Original URL: https://code.kx.com/platform/ml/

KX Delta Platform offers full integration with the KX Machine Learning Toolkit
through a KX Delta Platform asset package. It offers the full functionality
available detailed at [code.kx.com](https://code.kx.com/q/ml/#machine-
learning-toolkit).

Currently all Linux flavours supported by the KX Delta Platform support
Machine Learning Toolkit integration; including Ubuntu 18 and Red Hat 7/8.

## KxMl prerequisites

Please ensure that you have the [embedPy KX Delta Platform
Asset](https://code.kx.com/platform/embedpy/) in the relevant packages
directory on install. All embedPy dependenices will also need to be installed
as well as the following python libraries which are outlined in
[requirements.txt](https://github.com/KxSystems/ml/blob/master/requirements.txt)

    
    
    numpy
    scipy
    scikit-learn<=0.23.0
    statsmodels
    matplotlib
    sobol-seq
    pandas>=1.0
    

The only other requirement is the ability to update the `$QHOME` with the
necessary library as part of the KX Delta Platform installation.

## KX Delta Platform KxMl asset installation

The KxMl Platform asset is installed in the same way as all KX Delta Platform,
KX Delta Platform assets and Solution packages are installed. Place the
package in the relevant package directory and run through the installation
script. Further details on KX Delta Platform and package deployment can be
