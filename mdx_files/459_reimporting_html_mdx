# Reimporter module - PyKX

Original URL: https://code.kx.com/pykx/api/reimporting.html

PyKX reimport helper module.

PyKX uses various environment variables to monitor the state of various
modules initialization. This is required to manage all of the different modes
of operation, however it can cause issues when attempting to reimport PyKX
within a spawned subprocess.

This module provides a mechanism to allow users to safely reimport PyKX within
spawned subprocesses without having to manually manage any of these internal
environment variables.

###  `PyKXReimport`

    
    
    PyKXReimport()

Helper class to help manage the environment variables around reimporting PyKX
in a subprocess.

It is strongly recommended to use this class by using the python `with`
syntax. This will ensure all the environment variables are reset and restored
correctly, without the need to manage this yourself.

**Examples:**

    
    
    with kx.PyKXReimport():
        # This process can safely import PyKX
        subprocess.Popen(f"python other_file.py")

####  reset

    
    
    reset()

It is not recommended to use this function directly instead use the `with`
syntax.

This will automatically manage setting and restoring the environment variables
for you.

####  restore

    
    
    restore()

It is not recommended to use this function directly instead use the `with`
syntax.

This will automatically manage setting and restoring the environment variables
for you.
