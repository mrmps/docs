Compare code for additions, deletions, and changes as well as conflict resolution on merge. | ◆ | ◆ | ◆  
**Automated test support**  
Complete support for automated test creation using a behavioral driven (BDD) testing framework similar to Cucumber and a property library similar to QuickCheck for automatically generating test cases. Code coverage is also supported. | ◆ | ◆ | ◆  
**Visual Inspector**  
Query & visualize massive datasets in real-time with a wide range of pre-built charts using a point-and-click interface to set a wide variety of visual attributes. | ◆ | ◆ | ◆  
**Grammar of Graphics library**

**Data import wizard**  
Import any kind of delimited data (e.g. CSV), JSON, XML, INI, ODBC, JDBC and any kdb+ dataset without programming using a point-and-click interface. | ◆ | ◆ | ◆  
**Data export wizard**  
Export your data as delimited data (e.g. CSV), JSON, XML, INI, ODBC, JDBC or any type of kdb+ table without programming using a point-and-click interface. | ◆ | ◆ | ◆  
**Big data ETL & query tool (Transformer)**  
Perform extract, transform and load (ETL) operations as well as join and query operations on multiple datasets without programming using a point-and-click interface. |  | ◆ | ◆
