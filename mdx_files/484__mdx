On the _KX Monitoring_ dashboard the _DMLog_ screen manages queries on the
`dxLog` and `dxAccessLog` tables. (You must have [turned on
publishing](../monitoring-configuration/#process-publishing) of `dxLog` and
`dxAccessLog`.)

## Log summary

This panel summarizes the number of log events per hour for each process.
`dxAccessLog` messages are published from processes that have accesslog
configured.

Process | process that would publish the log messages.  
Bucket (mins) | size of the time buckets in which to group the returned dataset  
Level | (optional) view all messages or just `WARN`, `ERROR` or `INFO`
