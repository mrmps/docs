# Analyzing your data

Data analysis within kdb Insights Enterprise is facilitated from the UI
primarily through use of the Query Window. Aimed principally at data
scientists and data engineers it provides an isolated location where you can
prototype analytics and explore available data in an area which will not
impact production workloads.

The scratchpad provides you with a location to analyze data you have queried
from the database. Analysis can be completed in Python or q allowing you to to
create functions for use throughout kdb Insights Enterprise, interrogate your
data to learn more about its properties or to prototype pipelines prior to
deployment to production environments. Querying the database is completed
through use of a query builder, SQL or via q allowing you flexibility in
choosing how you access your data. During analysis users can inspect their
data via a console output, a table formatted return or through generation of
visualization in the visuals tab.

Use the guides below to discover how to use the Query Window to query data,
