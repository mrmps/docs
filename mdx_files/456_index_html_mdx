# Stream Processor APIs

The Stream Processor has two supported programming interfaces for writing
streaming applications, one in q and one in Python.

To interact with the Stream Processor at runtime, refer to the OpenAPI REST
interface.

  * [Coordinator OpenAPI](rest/coordinator.html) This is the primary interface for interacting with the Stream Processor. Use the Coordinator interface to deploy and teardown pipelines. This interface is available using a Kubernetes service name `<release>-kxi-sp:5000`.
  * [Controller OpenAPI](rest/controller.html) The controller interface offers localized feedback on a single pipeline. This interface is only accessible in a microservice deployment or using a port forward in a platform deployment.
  * [Worker OpenAPI](rest/worker.html) The worker interface allows for introspection of the runtime state of a given worker. This interface is only accessible in a microservice deployment or using a port forward in a platform deployment.

Warning

The Stream Processor prior to 1.4.0 kdb Insights and kdb Insights Enterprise
supported the creation of Stream Processors with many-to-one connections for
configurations where this was not supported. This has been removed as support
for this feature causes issues with determinism in pipelines and should be
avoided. To facilitate scenarios where many-to-one connections are required
use the merge nodes provided in [Python](python/operators.html#merge) or
[q](q/operators.html#qspmerge) to connect data into a single connection.

## Deprecation Policy

Code that is marked as `deprecated` is subject to be removed in the next major
release. Deprecated APIs will be maintained for all minor versions of a
release but will print a warning indicating that they are deprecated. All
deprecated APIs will indicate a path for upgrade in the relevant
documentation. See the [release notes](../../microservices/stream-
processor/release-notes.html) for details on any deprecated or removed APIs.
