# Table Creation, Modification and Deletion

`KX SQL` supports the [Data Definition Language
(DDL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_definition_language) which can be
used to handle the database descriptions and schemas. It can also be used to
define and modify the structure of the data.

## Create

`CREATE` can be used to create a new table in kdb Insights Core in memory.

**Examples**

  * Creating an empty table of 2 columns, using varchar and float to define columns of q type symbol and float respectively:
    
        s)CREATE TABLE tripsFare (vendor varchar,fare float)
    s.e.SELECT * FROM tripsFare
    

  * Creating an empty table of 10 columns, using a number of different data types:
    
        s)CREATE TABLE cars (id int, Name varchar(250), "Miles_per_Gallon" smallint, "Cylinders" smallint, "Displacement" smallint, "Horsepower" smallint, "Weight_in_lbs" smallint NOT NULL, "Acceleration" smallint, "Year" date NOT NULL, "Origin" character varchar(60));
    s.e.SELECT * FROM cars
    

Note

We could also have used char(n>1) here. If we wanted to define a column of q
type char - we would use char(1).

See here for a full list of supported data types.

## Insert

`INSERT` can be used to add new records to a table in memory.

**Examples**

## Drop

`DROP` can be used to delete a kdb Insights Core table from memory.

**Examples**

  * Dropping a table:
    
        s)DROP table IF EXISTS tripsFare
