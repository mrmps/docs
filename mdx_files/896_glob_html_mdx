# Glob Patterns

Glob patterns provide a way to specify a path that can match one or more
files, such as `data/*.json` to match all json files in a directory.

## Wildcards

  * `?` will match any single character  
Example: `2020?stats.csv` would match `2020-stats.csv` or `2020_stats.csv`,
but not `2020stats.csv`

  * `*` will match any string in a directory or file name, including the empty string, but won't match across directories  
Example: `/data*/test.csv` will match `/data/test.csv` and `/data-
backup/test.csv`, but not `/data/backup/test.csv`

  * `**` will match any number of directories, recursively searching through directories and symlinks (while not traversing a cyclic symlink)  
Example: `/data/**/test.csv` will match `/data/test.csv`,
`/data/backup/test.csv`, and `/data/backup/test/init/test.csv`

## Character Classes

  * `[...]` \- An expression between brackets not starting with `!` and that is not empty matches any single character in the set.  
Example: `/data/test.[ct]sv` will match `/data/test.csv` and `/data/test.tsv`

  * `[!..]` \- An expression between brackets starting with `!` matches any single character except the characters in the set. This is only true if `!` is the first character.  
Example: `/data/test-[!ABC].csv` will match `/data/test-D.csv` but not
`/data/test-B.csv`

  * `[ - ]` \- With a character set, the use of `-` indicates a range using the ASCII range from the character on the left to the character on the right. These can be used in both the inclusive and exclusive character classes.  
Example: `/data/test[0-9].csv` will match `/data/test0.csv` and
`/data/test5.csv`

  * Multiple ranges can be included in a character class, alongside characters not in a range.  
Example: `/data/test-[a-zA-Z0-9#].csv` will match `/data/test-3.csv` and
`/data/test-#.csv`

  * `*` and `?` are not special characters inside a character class. They will only match the characters `*` and `?`.

## Escaping special characters

The special characters outside a character class are `*`, `?`, and `[`.  
Inside or a character class, `!`, `-`, and `]` are the only special
characters, and `!` is only special when it is the first character.  
An unmatched `]` is not a special character

Character classes can be used to escape special characters.  
Example: `/data/test[?].csv` will match `/data/test?.csv` but not
`/data/test2.csv`  
Example 2: `test[[]backup].csv` will match `test[backup].csv`, as `[[]` is a
character class matching `[`

`\` should not be used as an escape character. `/data/my\ file.txt` should be
written instead as `/data/my file.txt`

## Notes

Glob patterns are case sensitive if the file system is case-sensitive.
