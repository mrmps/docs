# Database

The database has two categories of interfaces, queries and custom
aggregations. This section outlines the available APIs for interacting with
the kdb Insights Database. See the page on [exploratory
queries](../../enterprise/visualization/query.html) if you are looking to
execute a query using the kdb Insights user interface.

## Query interfaces

Queries can be performed using a [REST interface](rest/index.html), or
[interprocess communication](query/index.html). These APIs use common
[headers](api/header.html) and [return codes](api/codes.html) for reporting
status.

### REST interface
