_A Drop Down List used with a Bubble Chart_

## Set up

  1. Define the [view state parameter](../viewstateparameters/) to map to the dropdown.

  2. Use either a data source or item list to populate your dropdown.

  3. Give your dropdown a label, check _Multi-select_ if required

## Basics

_Name_

    A name for the component provided by the user. 
_Data Source_

    

Create a [data source](../datasources/) with the content of the dropdown menu;
using a data source will automatically populate the dropdown, just ensure the
data source has values in the correct format and type to pass into the linked
_Selected Value_ [View State Parameter](../viewstateparameters/). An optional
text column can be included for value display names.

_A query for a Drop Down List data source_

    

A sample query to use is (if connecting to the sample data connection source
`htmlevalcongroup` available in the sample demo dashboard set):

    
    
    select distinct src from dfxQuote
    

_Selected Value_

    

The view state parameter populated by the dropdown selection.

[Selected values](../viewstateparameters/#selected-values)

_Label_

    

The label next to the dropdown

_Accept Empty Values_

    

When checked, an available null value is added to the selection

Null value must be part of available data

When enabled, ensure the data column supplying the dropdown menu contains a
null value. This will not add a null value if not already available.

_Force Selected Value_

    

When checked, the dropdown will populate a _Selected Value_ [View State
Parameter](../viewstateparameters/) with either the defined default or
selected value. This ensures any associated queries dependent on the dropdown
input will have a value assigned to the [View State
Parameter](../viewstateparameters/).

_Multi-select_

    

When checked, multiple selections can be made from the dropdown list and the
selected items passed to the _Selected Value_ View State Parameter.

_Show Search_

    

When checked, includes a search box for filtering results

_Advanced Search_

    Supports wildcard searches, along with `AND`, `OR` and for excluding items from search using `-`, e.g. `EUR and GBP`, `EUR or GBP`, `EUR -*GBP`
_Horizontal_

    Horizontal alignment of items within the list
_Vertical_

    Vertical alignment of items within the list
_Tooltip_

    Text description to appear when user mouses over the dropdown 
_Width_

_Label Width_

    

Pixel width of menu and dropdown _Label_. If the _Label_ is wider than _Label
Width_ , it will wrap.

_Field Summary Threshold_

    How many items will be shown in the input field before changing to summary; e.g. _3 of 20_ when value of `3` is set
_Tooltip Summary Threshold_

    How many items will be shown in the tooltip before changing to summary; e.g. _10 of 20_ when value of `10` is set
_'Select All' Value_

    

This is the value assigned to the _Selected Value_ viewstate when all items
are selected in the dropdown; in the absence of an all-select, each individual
selected item will be listed in the _Selected Value_ viewstate. The default
value is `all`.

Configuration

The defined value will be used instead of the full list when all items are
selected; i.e. your backend should expect `all` rather than the full list.
This value can also be set as the default value if using a view state to
ensure all items are selected on load.

_Sort List by Selected_

    When checked and the dropdown is expanded to show the items available for selection, the selected values will be displayed at the top of the list.

## Data Source Mapping

![Screenshot](../img/dropdown/datasourcemapping.jpg)

When a _Data Source_ is used to populate the Drop Down List, the items of the
_Data Source_ will automatically be assigned. For separate labels and values,
use _Data Source Mapping_.

_Value_

    The column of the _Data Source_ corresponding to the values to be passed into the _Selected Value_ View State Parameter
_Text_

    The column of the _Data Source_ corresponding to the text to be displayed as the dropdown options

## Grouping

![Screenshot](../img/dropdown/grouping.jpg)

_Use Group By_

    If checked uses an extra level of nesting within the dropdown list
_Group By_

    determines which datasource column is used to group by

## Items

![Screenshot](../img/dropdown/itemsdropdownlist.jpg)

If _Data Source_ is not used to populate a Drop Down List, individual values
can be specified in the _Items_ menu.

## Custom

Customise dropdown selections with icons and icon colors

![Screenshot](../img/dropdown/iconsdropdownlist.png)

_Icon_

    The column of the _Data Source_ corresponding to the values to be used as an Icon 
_Icon Color_

    

The column of the _Data Source_ corresponding to the values to be used as the
Icon color

Configuration

For Icon: We could set a font awesome class i.e. "fa fa-book" - this would set
the icon to a font awesome book icon. For Icon Color: We could use a hex or
string color i.e. "red" or "#ff0000" - this would set the icon color to red
