# Data entitlements quickstart

This page guides you through an example of entitling users to query data from
an assembly called `sdk-sample-assembly`. It assumes that two sample groups,
_dataScience_ and _dashboardUsers_ , have been created.

Make sure that you have completed the [prerequisites](prerequisites.html)
before using this quickstart.

### Creating an entitlement

  1. Find the Group IDs provided by Keycloak for the _dataScience_ and _dashboardUsers_ groups.

To do this, call the `kxi entitlement actors` command:

    
        [
        {
            "id": "4745c0ae-4ef0-4bba-a310-bd2fc7236484",
            "name": "dataScience",
            "path": "/dataScience"
        },
        {
            "id": "7dcd08d8-28d9-40ae-9d9a-399a3ccc688f",
            "name": "dashboardUsers",
            "path": "/dashboardUsers"
        }
    ]
    

  2. Store each group ID to a variable called `$GROUPID1`,`$GROUPID2`.

  3. Store an access level permission for each group to a variable called `$ACCESS`. This example uses `RWX` for both groups.
  4. Create a ID for the `sdk-sample-assembly`. In this example we have generated one `a3f7be9f-8bd3-41b0-8c29-c50e19ac3914`.
  5. Call the `kxi entitlement create` command as follows:
    
        ID=a3f7be9f-8bd3-41b0-8c29-c50e19ac3914
    NAME=sdk-sample-assembly
    TYPE=assembly
    ACCESS=RWX
    kxi entitlement create $ID $NAME $TYPE --groups $GROUPIDs:$ACCESS
    

  6. Check the entitlement was created by calling `kxi entitlement list` or `kxi entitlement get`.

In this example we call the `get` command, passing in the ID of the newly
created entity.

    
        kxi entitlement list
    kxi entitlement get $ID

time _kdb Insights Enterprise_ takes to action any updates

See the kdb Insights CLI documentation for full details on the [`kxi
entitlements`](../kxi-cli/cli.html#kxi-entitlement) command and
[here](configuration.html#entitlement-fields) for an explanation of the fields
returned by the commands executed above.
