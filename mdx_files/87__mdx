# Coordinate systems

All plot specifications requires a coordinate system. By default, rectangular
(Cartesian) coordinates are used. This can be changed to polar coordinates by
using `.gg.coords.polar` (see `.qp.s.coord`).

## .gg.coords.cube

3D coordinate system

3D points are plotted via orthographic projection onto a 2D plane, which is
tangential to a point on the unit sphere defined by 2 angles, the azimuth, and
the altitude.

The azimuth is the angle between the point and the X axis along the X-Y plane.
The altitude is the angle between the point and the X-Y plane. For more about
azimuth/altitude, see: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azimuth>

**Parameters:**

Name | Type | Description  
---|---|---  
azimuth | float |   
altitude | float |
