# Configuration in the FSI Accelerator

In general any adjustable configuration has been condensed into a single
configuration file for each assembly/package; in the cases where there is
adjustable configuration relevant to that assembly. For the `fsi-lib` package,
this is in the `fsi.config.q` file. In other assemblies/packages the
equivalent file will be highlighted in the applicable section of
documentation. Any adjustments to configuration should be made before
deploying any assemblies.

The steps to adjust configuration in the `fsi-lib` package are:

  * unpack the `fsi-lib` package
  * edit the `src/fsi.config.q` file and update the configuration/variables to the desired values
  * re-package the `fsi-lib` package
  * push the `fsi-lib` package
  * bounce the aggregators and resource-coordinators

The steps would be the same for the other packages in the FSI Accelerator.

Commands to unpack and re-package a package can be found
[here](customize.html#unpack-fsi-data-assembly).

Commands to push a package and bounce aggregators/resource-coordinators can be
found [here](deploy.html#push-the-packages).

## Changing configuration via a custom package

Alternatively, in many cases configuration can be adjusted by including
variables in a custom package. Where this is possible it will be highlighted
in the applicable section of documentation. Instructions to create and load a
custom package can be found [here](customize.html#adding-custom-configuration-
or-code).
