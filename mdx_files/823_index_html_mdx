# Kafka Ingestion Example

_Streams data from Kafka and writes to a data sink_

[Kafka](https://www.confluent.io/lp/apache-kafka/) organizes streaming data
into topics which are subdivided by numeric independent partitions. This
example walks through creating a simple Java Kafka producer that publishes
data into a Kafka broker to be consumed by the kdb Insights Stream Processor.

Use TLS in production

It is recommended for production deployments that Kafka be configured with TLS
encryption. For a guide on setting up TLS with Kafka and the KX Stream
Processor, refer to the [Kafka with TLS](tls-ingest.html) guide.

This example is broken down into multiple parts for setting up, running, and
adding TLS.
