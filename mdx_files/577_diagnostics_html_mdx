# RT Diagnostics

RT provides a diagnostics API which you can run to return information about
the state and health of the RT cluster.

This diagnostics report is intended to be viewed by a Support team to
troubleshoot problems that arise when access to the RT cluster is not
available.

## Requesting Diagnostics

To return the diagnostics you must call an API on the RT supervisor process
running in you kubernetes cluster.

Note

You should perform this call on each of the nodes in the RT cluster as each
node will return it's own set of diagnostics.

Details on this API are available [here](rest/index.html).
