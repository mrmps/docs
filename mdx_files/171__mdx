# Breadcrumbs

A screen control that can be used for Pivot/OLAP navigation

![Screenshot](../img/breadcrumbs/breadcrumbhtmllight.jpg)

## Set up

  1. Assign a view state to the _Path_ property. When using the Breadcrumbs component for Pivot/OLAP navigation, this viewstate is shared with the [_Focus_](../pivotgrid/#basics) property of the [Pivot Grid](../pivotgrid/). 

  2. Assign a view state of type `list` to the _Visible Breadcrumbs_ property. The value of this view state depicts the order of the visible breadcrumbs. When using the Breadcrumbs component for Pivot/OLAP navigation, this viewstate is shared with the [_Breakdown Cols_](../datasources/#pivot-query) field in the Pivot Grid's Data Source/Pivot Query section.

## Settings

_Name_

    A name for the component provided by the user. 
_Path_

    

A [View State Parameter](../viewstateparameters/):

  * With comma separated values or values from a list data type.
  * Each value corresponds to the sequential list of visible breadcrumbs. 
  * Instead of using the _Visible Breadcrumbs_ property for the breadcrumb text, the value from the _Path_ property provides the text to be displayed, if a value is present and the _Use Path For Alternative Text_ is checked. Otherwise, the text comes from the _Visible Breadcrumbs_ property.

    

When using the Breadcrumbs component for Pivot/OLAP navigation, e.g. charts
and [Pivot Grid](../pivotgrid/), this view state shares their _Focus_ setting.

_Visible Breadcrumbs_

    

A View State Parameter of `list` data type:

  * These values represent the sequential list of visible breadcrumbs in the order that they appear.

When using the Breadcrumbs component for Pivot/OLAP navigation, e.g. charts
and [Pivot Grid](../pivotgrid/), this view state shares their _Breakdown_
setting.

_Use Path For Alternative Text_

    When checked, instead of using the _Visible Breadcrumbs_ property for the breadcrumb text, the value from the _Path_ property provides the text to be displayed, if present. If there is no corresponding value for a breadcrumb, the text will come from the _Visible Breadcrumbs_ property. 
    

When unchecked, the text of each breadcrumb comes solely from the values of
the view state that has been assigned to the _Visible Breadcrumbs_ property.

  * For Pivot/OLAP navigation to use the data source column names in the breadcrumbs, uncheck the _Use Path For Alternative Text_ property.

_Allow Reordering_

    

When checked, each breadcrumb listed in the _Visible Breadcrumbs_ view state
can be reordered using drag and drop or the Edit Breadcrumbs dialog.

_Breadcrumb Data Source_

    

(Optional) The list of values returned by the [data source](../datasources/)
assigned to this property provides a complete set of breadcrumb elements
available for use by this component. The first column in each row returned by
this data source becomes a breadcrumb element. This property is only available
when the _Allow Reordering_ property is checked.

    ([]
            c:(`Prov`County`AvgTemp`Population`Rainfall`HoursSun`TempHigh`TempLow)
    )
    

_Available Breadcrumbs_

    

(Optional) As an alternative to the _Breadcrumb Data Source_ , users can
assign a view state parameter of type `list` to provide a complete set of
breadcrumb elements available for use by this component. However, if the
_Breadcrumb Data Source_ is defined, that setting will supersede this
property. This property is only available when the _Allow Reordering_ property
is checked.

_Show Edit Button_

    

When checked, displays the Edit button
![Screenshot](../img/breadcrumbs/editbutton.png) to the left of the Home icon.
This property is only available when the _Allow Reordering_ property is
checked.

## Edit Breadcrumbs dialog

Clicking on the Edit button ![Screenshot](../img/breadcrumbs/editbutton.png)
will bring up the Edit Breadcrumbs dialog. This dialog allows users to add,
remove and change the order of the breadcrumbs.

![Screenshot](../img/breadcrumbs/editbreadcrumbsdialog.png)

_Available_

    This section contains a list of breadcrumbs that are available but not visible in the Breadcrumbs component. To make an available breadcrumb visible, drag and drop it from the _Available_ breadcrumbs list to the _Visible_ breadcrumbs list.
_Visible_

    This section contains a list of the visible breadcrumbs in the order that they will appear. To rearrange the list, drag and drop the breadcrumbs within this section.
    To remove a visible breadcrumb, drag and drop it from the _Visible_ breadcrumbs list to the _Available_ breadcrumbs list. 
_Warning Icon_

    

A warning icon may appear to the right of a breadcrumb element in the
_Available_ list when a breadcrumb is moved from _Visible_ to _Available_.

![Screenshot](../img/breadcrumbs/editbreadcrumbsdialogwarningicon.png)

    

This occurs if one of the following is true:

  * The _Breadcrumb Data Source_ or _Available Breadcrumbs_ property is not defined. 
  * The breadcrumb element exists in the _Visible Breadcrumbs_ viewstate but it is not found in the complete set of breadcrumbs defined by the _Breadcrumb Data Source_ or _Available Breadcrumbs_ property. 

    

In either case, any breadcrumb element displaying a warning icon will be
permanently removed during the session when the user commits their change by
clicking the OK button.

## Component behavior

  * Breadcrumbs with a corresponding value in the _Path_ property can be clicked on and rearranged.
  * Breadcrumbs without a corresponding value in the _Path_ property can only be rearranged.
  * When the user clicks on a breadcrumb with a corresponding value in the _Path_ property, the path will be truncated to that point.
