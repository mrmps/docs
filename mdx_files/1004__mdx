# 4.8.0 - KX Delta Platform

Original URL: https://code.kx.com/platform/release_480/

# Changes in 4.8.0

## Key changes

## Kdb Insights

From version 4.8.0, the KX Delta Platform is underpinned by kdb Insights.

[kdb Insights](https://code.kx.com/insights/1.3/core/index.html)

This will allow access to features of kdb Insights in the KX Delta Platform:

  * REST API
  * Object Storage
  * SQL

Access to each of these is enabled via feature flags in the kdb+ license file
(k4.lic/kc.lic)  [Licenses](../deployment/licenses/#Licenses)

KX Delta Platform on Windows

Kdb Insights features are not supported on Windows. KX Delta Platform version
4.8.0 will still use kdb+ on Windows.

Using kc.lic

To use a kc.lic instead of the default k4.lic set the `use-kc-lic` option at
install, [install options](../deployment/install_config_options/#General-
options)

Supported operating systems

Kdb Insights does not support some of the older operating systems that the KX
Delta Platform supports, [supported operating
systems](../deployment/prerequisites/#Kdb-insights)

### REST API

REST Client, provides sync and async methods callable from q. Also provides
ease-of-use cloud integration by registering cloud platform authentication
information.

REST Server, exposes a RESTful interface to a kdb+ based system.

server/index.html)

### Object Storage

Kdb Insights running beneath the KX Delta Platform allows authentication with
cloud credentials via Kurl to get native access to cloud object storage.

[Object storage](https://code.kx.com/insights/1.3/core/objstor/main.html)

### SQL

Support for ANSI SQL is built into kdb Insights. KX SQL means a user does not
need knowledge of the q language to access KX Delta Platform data.
