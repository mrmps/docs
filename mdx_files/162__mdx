# Summary

If you have followed the examples, you have successfully built a basic data
warehouse with service classes. The core components include, a data feed _RTE_
that generates random data, a _TP_ that captures data and publishes to
relevant subscribers, and an _RTE_ that aggregates data in realtime. The _LR_
does intraday writedowns that divides and saves data on the _RDB_ , _IHDB_ ,
and _HDB_.

However, data is only of use when we are able to effectively extract them. In
the next section, we will go over how to query this data using multiple
clients.
