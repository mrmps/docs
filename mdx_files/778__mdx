# Raising support issues

The _KX Delta Platform_ bundles come with a set of support scripts which can
be executed to collate the relevant host and environment info. The scripts
should be executed on each of the affected hosts in the environment and the
TGZ files should be provided along with a detailed description of the issue
when reporting the problem.

    
    
     ./runSupportScripts.sh
    +----------------------------------------------------------+
    Current install location [~/kxinstall]:
    

This will run the `checkHosts.sh`, `checkEnv.sh` and `validateCerts.sh` (if
applicable) and generate timestamped tgz files.
