# Workflows

Workflows control the start order of process instances.

A workflow is a list of tasks and connections between tasks.

A task is a process instance scheduled to run. Each task starts only once all
its parent tasks are running successfully.

Tasks can also be set to require manual approval before continuing.

When a process failure is detected, a workflow to take corrective action can
be launched automatically.

## Create a workflow

  1. From the _File_ menu, create a new workflow and assign it to a package.

  4. Save the workflow.

  5. Once saved, the workflow can be started.

When starting a workflow, if there are existing tasks with the same port
definitions these should be stopped to avoid port conflicts when running the
workflow.

Stop the workflow and restart if required. The status can be checked from the
_Workflow Status_ tab:

### Workflow history

The _History_ tab shows the tasks over time, whether they are running,
finished, launching, etc.
