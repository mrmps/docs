# Historic Fixed Income Data

To populate the historic elements of the Fixed Income Overview and Drilldown
Insights views there must be bar data for the relevant period. The Fixed
Income Accelerator includes a bar generation pipeline to generate this data
from the `Quote` table on configurable dates. This pipeline can be run
manually or scheduled. Details on how to run the pipeline manually can be
found here, [Setting up Manual Bar Generation](ice-fi-manual-
bargeneration.html). Steps to run the pipeline with a schedule can be found
here, [Setting up Bar Generation](ice-fi-daily-bargeneration.html).

For example, the bar generation pipeline could target data ingested from an
ICE REPLAY file to the `Quote` table for a particular date, generating bar
data for this date. This could be achieved by running bar generation manually.
Alternatively, the bar generation pipeline could be used to generate bar data
from `Quote` data ingested from the real time feed, this could be for
yesterday's date for example, in which case bar data for yesterday would be
generated. Running bar generation on a daily schedule could be the most
convenient way to achieve this.
