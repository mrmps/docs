# LDAP

The _KX Delta Platform_ supports, LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)
which is an open and cross platform protocol used for directory services
authentication.

### Enabling LDAP at deploy time

LDAP can be enabled at deploy time if you are using a custom install.config
file. The following option should be added:

    
    
    delta-control-use-ldap=1
    

This will result in `DELTACONTROL_LDAP` in delta.profile pointing to a
configuration file called LDAP_EX.txt

    
    
    export DELTACONTROL_LDAP=${DELTA_CONFIG}/LDAP_EX.txt
    

In order to start the deploy you will need to create the file and configure
the LDAP settings. This is covered in the _KX Control_ documentation.

### Enabling LDAP post deploy

To enable LDAP post deploy, you can add the `DELTACONTROL_LDAP` variable to
the `delta.profile` manually and point it to the LDAP configuration file on
disk.

**Linux**

    
    
    export DELTACONTROL_LDAP=${DELTA_CONFIG}/LDAP_EX.txt
    

**Windows**

    
    
    set DELTACONTROL_LDAP=%DELTA_CONFIG%/LDAP_EX.txt
