# Report client

The report client functionality provides APIs to run reports programmatically.
The process communicates with the report generator via the _QR_ framework.

The functionality can be enabled on a process by calling `.rpt.client.enable`
and providing a callback to execute when the registration is complete.

APIs are provided to run reports;

  * `.rpt.client.run` \- runs a specific instance with default params and actions
  * `.rpt.client.runActions` \- runs an instance with specified params and actions
  * `.rpt.client.runDict` \- run with specified params, actions, timeout and target

Report instances definitions will also be loaded into the process on enabling
the client functionality. APIs are provided to get these definitions and check
the status of reports.

See the _Template API Guide_ for more information.
