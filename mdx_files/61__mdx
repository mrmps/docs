## Release bundles

_KX Delta Platform_ releases, come in the form of bundles, which are
compressed files (zip or tgz) which include the necessary contents to be able
to install/deploy the _KX Delta Platform_ , including packages and scripts.

For Linux operating systems, bundles come in two forms;

  1. A general availability (GA) bundle
  2. A patch (Px) bundle

GA bundles will be released for every major release (e.g. 4.5.0, 4.5.1, 4.6.0
etc), subsequent updates to the major release will come in the form of patch
bundles. Patch bundles are cumulative, therefore there is no need to apply
each patch version individually, installing the latest patch will include all
previous patch releases.

For Windows, bundles come in the form of;

  1. A base bundle
  2. A patch (Px) bundle

The base bundle is the starting point for a _KX Delta Platform_ installation
on Windows, once you have the base bundle deployed and configured, you can
apply patch bundles. Each GA release will include 2 bundles. a base bundle and
GA patch bundle. The GA patch bundle will allow you to upgrade your base
bundle to the next major release.

### Eval bundles

Eval bundles are available for Linux and Windows, which are bundles available
for evaluation and demonstration purposes only. They contain sample data,
configuration and workflows.
