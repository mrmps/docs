# Windows

## Third-party software

### Java Runtime Environment (JRE)

The KX Delta Platform runs on the following supported JRE:

### OpenSSL

  * 1.0.2
  * 1.1 ( since kdb+ 4.0 2020.03.17 )

### Visual C++ redistributable

### 7-zip

To Unzip the Windows bundle you must use the 7-Zip Software.

7-Zip can be downloaded from [the 7-zip.org website](https://www.7-zip.org/)

## Host configuration

KDB licenses (`k4.lic`) are tied to the hostname of a machine and specifically
the hostname in FQDN (.) format. When run on a machine which is incorrectly
configured you will get a `host` error when running the q binary.

For more information on kdb+ license errors see
[code.kx.com](https://code.kx.com/q/basics/errors/#license-errors)

In order for kdb+ to run, the hostname in the license file must match the
hostname of the box.
