# Overview

Deprecation of deployment with assembly yaml files

The deployment of assembly yaml files using the `kxi assembly` command in the
kdb Insights CLI has been deprecated and may be removed from future releases.
You should instead use packages, which can be deployed and managed by both the
UI and the kdb Insights CLI. For more information about packages, refer to
[Packages](../packaging/index.html).

Assemblies are collections of services deployed in _kdb Insights Enterprise_
using the [kdb Insights CLI](../cli/index.html) and usually consist of
databases, schemas, streams, and pipelines. They are generally used to deploy
collections of interlinked services, i.e. a pipeline streaming EMEA data into
a database via two streams.

The following sections describe how to build and deploy assemblies.
