# KX Monitoring

_KX Monitoring_ gathers and displays information about the status of an
environment in real time. It offers the ability to monitoring any number of
servers within a system tracking critical server and process tatistics. Each
server requires a SysMon Java application installed and running to collect run
time information, while the _KX Dashboards_ provide powerful tools for
visualizing and analyzing the current and historical state of the system. As
well as an active real time view of the status of an environment _KX
Monitoring offers powerful out of the box Alerting for potential system issues
before they occur. The same Alert framework provided within the _KX Delta
Platform_ can be extended to allow additional alerts to be implemented as
required from the Monitored data.

The dashboard displays an overview of the current state of the system. It is
an aggregated view across all processes running on all servers.

panel | content  
---|---  
Top Processes | processes using the most CPU and memory  
Server Status | number of alerts per server and the status of each server  
Server Memory | free and used memory stats for all servers  
Server CPU | busy and idle percentages for all CPUs  
Server Disk Space | free and used disk space for each server  
Server Alerts | active alerts generated when server thresholds are breached  
  
## Top processes

Processes using the most CPU and memory: those using nominal levels of CPU and
memory are ignored.

column | description  
---|---  
PID | process ID  
SYM | host of the process  
NAME | type of process, e.g. q, Java  
ALIAS | configured alias for the process  
PERCENT | percentage CPU being used by the process  
MEMORY | Mb of memory used by the process  
ARGS | Process arguments  
  
## Server status

Number of alerts and the status of each server.

column | description  
---|---  
SERVER | server name  
TOTALERTS | total number of alerts per server  
STATUS | last alert on the server  
  
## Server memory

Free and used memory for all servers within the system. This can be useful in
identifying the servers using the most memory.

## Server CPU

![Screenshot](img/monitoring/servercpugraph.png)

Busy and idle percentages for all CPUs in each server within the system.

## Server disk space

This graph displays the free and used disk space for each server defined
within the system.

## Server alerts

_KX Monitoring_ fires active alerts when server thresholds are breached, ands
lists them in the Server Alerts table.
