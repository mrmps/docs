# Known limitations of streaming to Views

_This section describes the known limitations with streaming to Views._

  1. A filter can only act on one keyed column. 
  2. A filter can only have one value with no wildcards. Filtering on multiple values is not supported. The UI allows it but it results in a timeout on execute. 
  3. The keyed columns must be symbols not strings. If the keyed columns are strings, the filtering does not work. The columns need to be converted to symbols.
  4. Due to the use of json in the Streaming Data source **Filter** field you have to use a virtual query to ensure the dropdown value is converted into the correct JSON format. See [here](../walkthrough/report/streaming.html#filtering-based-on-a-dropdown) for an example of how this is setup.
