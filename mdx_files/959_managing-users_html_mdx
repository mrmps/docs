# Managing users

Users are entities that are able to log into your system. They can be assigned
[group](managing-groups.html) membership for use with [data
entitlements](../entitlements/index.html) and have specific
[roles](authentication.html#roles) assigned to them.

## Creating users

  1. Log into the administration console.
  2. Choose the target realm (`$REALM_NAME`) from the top-left realm drop-down.
  3. Click **Users** in the menu.
  4. Click **Add User**.
  5. Enter the details for the new user.
  6. Click **Save**.
  7. Give the user credentials:
    1. Click the **Credentials** tab
    2. Click **Set password**
    3. Choose a password and leave **Temporary** set to on
    4. Click **Save**
    5. Confirm by clicking on **Save password**

Ensure the correct realm is selected

Ensure you select the correct realm (`$REALM_NAME`) as the UI defaults to the
`Master` realm on login.

Use `kxi user` to create a new user.

    
    
    kxi user create $USERNAME \
        --email $EMAIL \
        --password $PASSWORD \
        --temporary
    

Replace the following:

  * `$USERNAME`: Username for the new user.
  * `$EMAIL`: Email for the new user.
  * `$PASSWORD`: Password for the new user.

Note

The user will be asked to reset their password on first login when the
`--temporary` flag is set

## Assigning roles

## Password resets

## Forgotten passwords

The application can provide password reset functionality via email if the
realm is configured with an [email server](authentication.html#configuring-
email).

  1. Log into the administration console.
  2. Click **Realm settings** in the menu.
  3. Click the **Login** tab.
  4. Toggle **Forgot password** to ON.

A 'Forgot password?' link will now be displayed on the login screen.

## Identity brokering

To use an identity provider other than Keycloak to authenticate users,
configure this under **Identity Providers** in the menu.

The setup for this varies depending on the type of identity provider.

Read the Keycloak documentation for your specific use case.

[Keycloak Identity
Brokering](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/#_identity_broker)

First login

A user that authenticates via a different identity provider than Keycloak must
log in at least once before roles can be assigned to them.

Identity provider is not visible on the login screen

If an identity provider is configured but you can't see it on the login
screen, ensure you are getting redirected to the correct login page:
`https://${INSIGHTS_HOSTNAME}/auth/admin/${REALM_NAME}/console/`
