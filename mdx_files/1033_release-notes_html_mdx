# Release Notes

## 1.1.0

This release introduces a number of stability enhancements to the Stream
Processor.

### New Features

  * Added new machine learning operators. See [machine learning API](../../api/stream-processor/q/ml.html) for details.
  * Worker and controller pods now support Kubernetes resource controls.
  * Added a [schema operator](../../api/stream-processor/q/transform.html#qsptransformschema) for best-effort schema conversions.
  * Added a [`GET /diagnostics`](../../api/stream-processor/rest/worker.html) API to the controller and worker for retrieving diagnostics reports.

### Changes

  * The coordinator now uses Kubernetes state to determine if a pipeline exists.
  * Worker pod naming has changed. See [`GET /pipeline/worker/{id}`](../../api/stream-processor/rest/coordinator.html) for retrieving worker DNS addresses.
