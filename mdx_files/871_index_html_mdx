## About

PyKX is a Python first interface to the world's fastest time-series database
kdb+ and its underlying vector programming language, q.

For Python developers, PyKX unlocks the speed and power of kdb+ for data
processing and storage from within your Python environment. It enables anyone
with Python knowledge to apply analytics against vast amounts of data, both
in-memory and on-disk, in a fraction of the time, allowing you to focus on
getting the best from your data.

For q developers, PyKX brings together Python's data science ecosystem and the
power of kdb+'s vector and time-series analytics. This makes them available in
both q and Python environments. You can use it to run q code within a Python
environment or embed Python analytics within your q session.
