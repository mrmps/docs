# Date Picker

![Screenshot](../img/datepicker/datepickerhtmllight.jpg)

Assigns a date input to a [View State Parameter](../viewstateparameters/)

The Date Picker will highlight dates found in the _Data Source_

## Set up

  1. Assign a [view state](../viewstateparameters/) with a data type containing a date to the _Selected Date_ property.
  2. Optionally set data source with `Date` data

## Basics

_Name_

    A name for the component provided by the user. 
_Label_

    Text label presented with the component in the Dashboard.
_Data Source_

    

[Data sources](../datasources/) Optionally set a list of valid dates that can
be chosen by the user. When set, the list of dates in the data source
identifies the range of dates presented by the date picker component.

Resulting data

The date picker data source must return values of kdb type "date".

_Selected Date_

    A View State Parameter with a data type containing a date
_Horizontal_

    Horizontal alignment (left, center or right) of date selector inside the component boundaries
_Vertical_

    Vertical alignment (top, middle, bottom) of date selector inside the component boundaries
_Tooltip_

    Text description which appears when user mouses over the _Date Picker_
_Width_

    Pixel width of dropdown
_Label Width_

    

Pixel width of dropdown _Label_

Tip

If assigned _Label Width_ is narrower than the _Label_ description, text in
the _Label_ will wrap.

## Validation

The date picker will verify its value to ensure that it is suitable for use
and present an error label if it is not. This inherent validation occurs as
the user is typing, when navigating to a different area of the Dashboard, and
upon initialization. If the value is not valid, the _Selected Date_ property
will not be updated, and one of the following error labels will appear:

_Invalid date/time_

An "Invalid date/time" error label will appear when the value does not
represent an actual calendar day (i.e. '00' for the day) or its time component
does not represent an actual time (i.e. '99' for the hour). If the value is
not corrected by the user, the date picker will use the previously held value
if possible.

_Date out of scope_

A "Date out of scope" error label will be visible when the date value is not
in the list of available dates provided by the date picker data source. This
error will remain visible until the user provides a valid value.

### Date Picker Validation within a Data Form component

    When using a Date Picker component within a Data Form, date picker validation errors such as "Invalid date/time" or "Date out of scope" must be resolved before the data form validation analytic will execute or the data form can be submitted.
