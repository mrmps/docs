# Ingestion examples overview

This section details some common use-cases for ingesting data into kdb
Insights Enterprise using the [kdb Insights CLI](../cli/index.html).

KX Nexus

The KX Nexus repository will be sunsetted in the future. Nexus links on this
page are provided as a temporary alternative to the KX Downloads Portal for
existing users. The KX Downloads Portal is the preferred repository for all
use cases and KX Nexus links will be removed once the KX Nexus repository is
decommissioned.

## Downloading assemblies

Each of the examples above _(not being generated by the UI)_ deploys a unique
[assembly CR](../assemblies/overview.html). The files used by these samples
are hosted on the [KX Downloads
Portal](https://portal.dl.kx.com/assets/raw/assembly-samples/) and should be
downloaded to run locally. If you deployed from Azure Marketplace, reach out
to [Support](../azure-marketplace/support.html) and they can provide sample
assembly examples for you.

Existing users can use the KX Nexus repository until Nexus is removed in the
future. You can retrieve the same sample files from the [KX
Nexus](https://nexus.dl.kx.com#browse/browse:kx-insights-packages:assembly-
samples) repository and use them in the same way as described above.

Firstly, get the correct version of the assemblies by running the command
below.

    
    
    export INSIGHTS_OPVERSION=$(kubectl get deployment/insights-kxi-operator --namespace kxi-operator -o jsonpath='{.metadata.labels.app\.kubernetes\.io/version}')
    

The assembly files can be downloaded and applied. The code block below does
this for the RT client assembly using the [kdb Insights
CLI](../assemblies/deploying-assemblies.html).

Replace `<USER>` and `<PASSWORD>` in the example command below with your Nexus
credentials.

    
    
    wget --user=<USER> --password=<PASSWORD> https://portal.dl.kx.com/assets/raw/assembly-samples/${INSIGHTS_OPVERSION}/sdk_sample_assembly.yaml
    
    kxi assembly deploy --filepath sdk_sample_assembly.yaml
    

## Querying data

After data is ingested by one of the sample assemblies, it can be queried
using the Service Gateway.

For full details on the available functionality for querying, refer to [Data
query overview](../database/query/index.html).
