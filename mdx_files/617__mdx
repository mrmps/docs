# Data Grid

![A Data Grid](../img/datagrid/sampleformats.jpg)  
_A Data Grid_

The key element is the data source, where the query or analytic is defined.

The Data Grid also has settings for search, filtering, editing cells, insert
and delete rows, sorting, grouping and custom column display.

## Set up

  1. Assign a _data source_.

  2. Select _filtering_ option to use.

  3. Format your column data; use the Multi-Column Editor to make shared changes across columns. 

## Basics

![Screenshot](../img/datagrid/datagridbasics.png)

_Name_

    A name for the component provided by the user. 
_Data Source_

     [Data sources](../datasources/)
_Filtering_

    

Three options:

option | effect  
---|---  
Quick Search | Global search of all data columns; e.g. for selected text, number, date or time ![Screenshot](../img/datagrid/gridquicksearch.jpg)  
Column Filters | Search on selected column. Additional filter options available with custom filters. ![Screenshot](../img/datagrid/columnfilters.jpg)  
Advanced Column Filters | Search on selected column, support for boolean operators `AND`, `OR`, `-` (`NOT`), and `*` (wildcard all). ![Screenshot](../img/datagrid/advancedcolumnfilters.jpg). Required for using server-side filtering.  
Disabled | No filters  
    

_Advanced Column Filters_

option | effect  
---|---  
* | Wild card, returns everything  
AND | Searching for `J AND M` would return a Jim but not a John or Mary  
OR | Search for `J OR M` would return a Jim, John and Mary  
- | Acts as a NOT. Search for `* -Jim -John` would return all bar Jim and Mary  
    

_Advanced Column Filtering_ is not available for columns using custom filters.

    

_Advanced Column Filtering_ must be selected if server side filtering is
employed.

_Show Paging Control_

    

When checked, displays pagination controls: used for large data sets

![Screenshot](../img/datagrid/pagingcontrol.jpg)

_Enable Grouping_

    When checked, users can group data together: subtotals can be applied with _Summary Row For Groupings_
_Auto Collapse Grouping_

    When checked, the dashboard is loaded with Data Grid groupings in collapsed form. Grid groupings are configured in _Grouping Columns_
_Keep NonExistent Columns_

    

Non-existent columns are employed when working with a large number of queries.
If a _Data Source_ is changed, the prior column configurations from the
original will be kept if this control is checked.

Dynamic queries

Dynamic queries which don’t have fixed column definitions can set _Keep
NonExistent Columns_ to retain configuration options; e.g. column formatting.
In this scenario, the `*` wildcard would be used in the _Data Field Name_.
Hybrid wildcard usage is also supported; for example 'Data*' will return all
columns with 'Data'.

_Custom Layout_

    

When checked, the Data Grid will have a button to summon the Configuration
dialog.

![Screenshot](../img/datagrid/configuration.jpg)

The Configuration dialog lets users change the display of columns in the Data
Grid.

![Screenshot](../img/datagrid/userconfiguration.jpg)  
_Configuration dialog_

All columns are available to users

Hidden columns will be visible in the _Available Columns_ list. This may not
be desirable if a hidden column stores a calculation or highlight rule
operator. In such instanced it may be necessary to disable _Custom Layout_.

User configuration is saved on exiting the dashboard and will be available on
next login.

_Retain Relative Column Widths on Reload_

    Check control to continue with relative width on display columns (relative widths are applied only when columns fit allocated horizontal space - when horizontal scrollbar is not visible)
_Edit Mode_

    

One of _enabled_ , _disabled_ , or _instant_. When _enabled_ , a user can edit
data by clicking the _Edit_ button in the top-right corner, making each cell
editable. When _instant_ , boolean values in the table will be rendered as
checkboxes that the user can toggle to instantly edit.

![Screenshot](../img/datagrid/editcell.jpg) _Editing data with Edit Mode =
enabled_

![Screenshot](../img/datagrid/instantEdit.png)

_Editing data with Edit Mode = instant_

In both cases, an [update query](../datasources/#update-query) must be used.

_Enable Insert/Delete_

    Only used with an [update query](../datasources/#update-query).
_Sort Column_

_Sort Order_

    Define which column, and direction, to sort data on dashboard load
_KDB Filter String_

    Used in server side filtering.
_Filter on Enter_

    When checked, user will have to press ENTER to return a filter result. Default behavior is to smart filter on typing. 
_Scroll Row_

    Stores a scroll value required for PDF Creation 
_Experimental Mode_

    Improved data handling efficiency and performance with high volume data
_Virtual Scroll_

    Default is `disabled`; all data is loaded to the dashboard from the _Data Source_. When enabled, viewed data is loaded as required; for streaming or frequently changing data and update queries, `uncached` is recommended, `cached` enables backend data management. 
_Expand When Creating Pdf_

    

When checked, datagrid will be printed on multiple pages

Limitations

Datagrid has to be placed inside [Tab Control](../datasources/). If header is
present, it will be printed on each page. Grouping is not supported.

_Footer Data Source_

    

This [data source](../datasources/) property can be used to provide customized
values in the footer section of the Data Grid.

  * Each column name returned by this data source becomes an additional option to choose from in the dropdown list of available footers. 
  * Only the first row of values resulting from this data source will be presented in the footer section of the Data Grid.

## Columns

Besides [individual column settings](./#column), settings for all columns can
be defined in the Multi Column Editor:

![Screenshot](../img/datagrid/globalconfigure.jpg)

Select columns on the left using Ctrl-click on columns.

Next select properties (settings) on the right to be applied across the
selected columns.

![Screenshot](../img/datagrid/multicolumn.jpg)

Columns can be removed from a Data Grid by clicking the trashcan icon

![Screenshot](../img/datagrid/deletecolumn.jpg)

## Column

Each column has a section defining how its data is formatted.

![Screenshot](../img/datagrid/datagridcolumn.png)

_User Defined_

    

When checked, the selected column will remain in the Data Grid if the selected
column variable is removed from the query. A User Defined query is effectively
a 'lock' on the column

_User Defined_ checked for missing _Data Source_ variable

The _User Defined_ column will show as an empty column in the Data Grid if the
_User Defined_ column variable is missing in the query.

_Data Field Name_

    

A column or [dynamic column](../datasources/#dynamic-columns) from the _Data
Source_

Dynamic column syntax

use * or regex (e.g. CPUCore*, FXpair*EUR, /symbol|sym/i )

_Display Name_

    

![Screenshot](../img/datagrid/displayname.jpg)  
_Columns with Display Names: Symbol, Counter Party, %, and Start Date_

Wildcard '*' usage

_Display Name_ is set to wildcard when _Data Field Name_ uses the wildcard.
Hybrid names using a mix of name label and wildcard are also supported; for
example, _Data Field Name_ set to 'Data*' with _Display Name_ of 'Result *'
will return columns including 'Data' with 'Result ' in the _Display Name_.

_Header Tooltip_

    Provides a rollover text description for the column; useful if existing column title is clipped on browser resize. 
_Width (relative)_

    

Column width relative to other columns, e.g. columns with a relative width of
20, 10, 5, 1 will scale to column widths of 55% (i.e. 20/(20+10+5+1)), 28%,
14% and 3%

Columns will resize with the browser window.

_Min Width (px)_

    

Pixels: the minimum width for a column

Using _Width (relative)_ and _Min Width (px)_ together

_Width (relative)_ uses a default value based on the data Type in the column;
in the case of a _Data Grid_ the default _Width (relative)_ and _Min
Width(px)_ are the same. There are two priority rules for _Width (relative)_
and _Min Width (px)_ :

  1. If the screen is resized so that a scroll bar appears, _Width (relative)_ will be disabled and only _Min Width (px)_ used. If a further resize removes the scrollbar, _Width (relative)_ will again be applied. 
  2. If the _Width (relative)_ is set to zero, only _Min Width (px)_ will be applied. 

If _Width (relative)_ (irrespective of scrollbar) narrows Data Grid column
widths to less than _Min Width (px)_ , then _Min Width (px)_ will be used.

Group apply Width changes

When using _Width (relative)_ or _Min Width (px)_ it may be helpful to use the
bulk parameter adjuster; click ![Screenshot](../img/datagrid/bulkadjust.jpg)

Ctrl+select the columns to change, then adjust the required parameter(s) to
have the value applied to all selected columns

![Screenshot](../img/datagrid/multiselectgroup.jpg)

_Text Align_

    Horizontal alignment of values in their cells
_Sortable_

    

![Screenshot](../img/datagrid/columnsort.jpg)

When checked, clicking on column header will toggle between ascending and
descending sorts

_Format_

    for the data in the column, e.g. `DateTime`, `Percentage`, `Sparkline`
_Precision_

    The number of decimal places show for numeric data
_Hide Trailing Zeroes_

    When checked, suppresses trailing zeroes for numeric data
_Currency Symbol_

    ![Screenshot](../img/datagrid/currencysymbol.jpg)  
_Columns with prefixed currency symbols_

_Date Format_

_Time Format_

    Where _Format_ is Date, Time, or DateTime the data is formatted with these two settings
    ![Screenshot](../img/datagrid/comboformat.jpg) ![Screenshot](../img/datagrid/timecolumn.jpg)  
_Date Format, Time Format, and a formatted DateTime column_

_Negative Color_

    Set color for negative values in column
Highlight Change

    When _Highlight Changes_ is enabled, higher than previous value changes will be highlighted in green and lower values in red. The length of time for the highlight is set by _Highlight Change Duration_
     [Highlight Rules](../highlightrules/)
Highlighting highs, lows and ranges

    

Checkboxes _Highlight Min Value_ , _Highlight Max Value_ , and _Range
Highlight_ apply colors to highlight values:

![Screenshot](../img/datagrid/minvaluecolor.jpg)
![Screenshot](../img/datagrid/maxvaluecolor.jpg)
![Screenshot](../img/datagrid/rangecolor.jpg)  
_Columns with Min Value Color, Max Value Color, and Range Color applied_

_Invert Range Color_

    Flip range color usage; dark shade for high values, light shade for low values
_Percentage Color_

    

A color, used for mini-bars when _Format_ is Percentage

![Screenshot](../img/datagrid/percentagehighlight.jpg)

Colors can be View State Parameters

_Min Value Color_ , _Max Value Color_ , _Range Color_ , and _Percentage Color_
can be [View State Parameters](../viewstateparameters/).

_Read Only_

    When checked, the column cannot be edited
_Selectable_

    Checked by default; column cells cannot be selected when unchecked
_Template_

    Apply HTML customizations with Handlebar helpers; for example:
    
    
    <font color="blue">{{column name}}</font>
    

    

where `{{column name}}` is the reference name for the column from the data
source.

    

[Templates](../template/)

_Sparkline Options_

    Configuration for Sparklines
_Hidden_

    Data column is hidden. 
     **When Hidden columns are no longer hidden**  
If _Full Excel Export_ is enabled, all _Hidden_ columns will be downloaded as
part of the export. _Hidden_ columns are also available under _Custom Layout_.

_Footer_

    

This property allows the user to specify what values are displayed in the
footer section of the Data Grid. Available options include `None`, `Average`,
`Count`, `Sum`, and `Weighted Average`.

![Screenshot](../img/datagrid/footerdropdown_default.png)

    

If at least one column has a _Footer_ property set to a value other than
`None`, the footer section appears as the last row at the bottom of the grid
display. Footer values inherit the format options of their column.

![Screenshot](../img/datagrid/datagridsum.png)

    

When a _Footer Data Source_ is defined, the columns returned by this data
source will be appended as additional options to the _Footer_ dropdown list.

![Screenshot](../img/datagrid/footerdropdown_columns.png)

    

To create labels in the footer section, text can be used as a footer value
even if the Column format is different.

Note

The Footer property will be set to _None_ if a custom footer is selected and
the _Footer Data Source_ changes to exclude the selected column.

_Footer Weight_

    Applies a weighting to current column by selected data source variable. For this to be enabled, _Footer_ must be set to `Weighted Average`.
_Header_

    

Applies a column grouped header.

![Screenshot](../img/datagrid/headergrouping.jpg)

Note

Auto size applied on grouped header when user resize columns. Column reorder
restricted within its group.

## Selection & Routing

![Screenshot](../img/datagrid/selectionrouting.jpg)

_Selection Mode_

    Select from `Area`, `Single Row`, `Multi Row` or `Cell`
_Row ID Column_

    Define from the [data source](../datasources/)
_Selected Row_

_Selected Column_

_Selected Cell Value_

    Assign [view state parameters](../viewstateparameters/) to each attribute when `Cell` is selected.
_Follow Selected Value_

    When checked, row selection highlight will retain view on screen during scroll event
_Default Fallback on Deselect_

    When checked, default View State Parameter values will be used (if set) in the absence of a row select
_Checkbox Alignment_

    Position of data row selection check boxes; select from `none`, `left` or `right`
_Select on checkbox only_

    Toggle whether the whole row can be selected or just the checkbox

### Keyboard Shortcuts

A set of keyboard shortcuts for _Selection Mode_ `Area`; allows for bulk
selection of cells and rows.

shortcut | description  
---|---  
Shift + End | Select to end of column from cell  
Shift + Home | Select to top of column from cell  
Shift + Page Up | Select from cell to each page up instance  
Shift + Page Down | Select from cell to each page down instance  
Shift + Click | Select from cell to click-select-cell  
Drag-select-rows | Select multiple rows  
  
### Action

[Actions](../action/)

## File export

[Export](../publish/#file-export)

_Position_

    Select from `none`, `right`, `left`, `cursor`
_Template_

     [Templates](../template/#data-grid)
_Use Formatted Cell Value_

    When the "Use Formatted Cell Value" property is checked then tooltip uses the formatted value from column template otherwise if unchecked uses the raw cell value.

## Grouping columns

![Screenshot](../img/datagrid/groupingcolumns.jpg)

A _Grouping Column_ groups Data Grid rows by their values in that column.
Specifying further grouping columns repeats this within each group.

![Screenshot](../img/datagrid/autocollapse.jpg)  
_Grouping by sym and counterParty_

Dashboard users can also create groupings on the fly by dragging a column
header into the space directly above the column headers:

![Screenshot](../img/datagrid/enablegroup.jpg)  
_Dragging a column header to set a grouping column_

## Summary Row for Groupings

_Grouping Columns_ reorganises the Data Grid layout. _Summary Row for
Groupings_ adds simple mathematical calculations to the groups.

![Screenshot](../img/datagrid/summaryrowgrouping.jpg)  
_‘Leverage’ calculated for each group_

![Screenshot](../img/datagrid/datagridsummaryrowforgroupings.png)

_Aggregate Function_

    The mathematical function to apply: `average`, `sum`, `min`, `max` or `weighted average` (extra column will appear)
_Column_

    The column on which the calculations will be made
_Label_

    The text label to use for the calculation
_Color_

    The font color for the grouping

## Highlight rules

Mark changes in data grid values with color; select between `Gradient` or
monotone `Discrete` colors.

![Screenshot](../img/datagrid/samplehighlightrules.jpg)  
_Highlight Rules in operation_

![Screenshot](../img/datagrid/highlightrule.jpg)

_Name_

    The name of the rule
_Target_

    The column on which the rule will act. Can be any column in the Data Grid: does not have to be the column using the operator.
_Condition Source_

_Condition Operator_

_Condition Value_

    Discrete highlight rule  [Highlight Rules](../highlightrules/)
_Rule Min_

_Rule Max_

_Rule Limit_

    Gradient highlight rule. _Rule Limit_ restricts highlights to values between _Rule Min_ and _Rule Max_ only; values outside of this range have no highlights applied. Use `Color Palette` to define gradient color highlights. 
_Color_

    The text color when rule is true
_Background Color_

    Background cell color when rule is true
_Border Color_

    Cell border color when rule is true

    Icon to appear when rule is true
_Icon Color_

    Color for the icon (if used) when rule is true
_Apply Palette To_

    Gradient highlight colors applied to `background`, `text`, `border` or `icon`

### Color Palette

Define colors used by `Gradient` highlight; low to high values, top to bottom.

## Custom filters

Introduce client-side advanced filters for columns covering text, numeric and
datetime formats.

Custom Filters are available only when _Filtering_ is set to _Column Filters_
or _Advanced Column Filters_.

Filtering is only applied to viewable data; paging will limit results to
current page.

![Screenshot](../img/datagrid/advancedcolumnfilters.jpg)  
_Custom Filters_

Select a custom filter for each columns

![Screenshot](../img/datagrid/extralinefilter.jpg)

filter | description  
---|---  
Selection | Filter dropdown; check available data options to display.  
Server Selection |  Server Selection Filtering  
Number | Support for filter options: `<`, `>`, `>=`, `<=`, `=`, `==`, `!=` (exclude)  
Date Time | Select for Date or Time using standard operators: `<`, `>`, `>=`, `<=`, `=`  
Disabled | No filtering  
  
Examples:

Symbol starts with `EUR` or `USD`:

    ![Screenshot](../img/datagrid/ik_ssf1.jpg)
Symbol starts with `EUR`, without `EURAUD`:

    ![Screenshot](../img/datagrid/ik_ssf2.jpg)
Symbol starts with `EUR`, without `EURAUD` and `EURCAD`:

    ![Screenshot](../img/datagrid/ik_ssf3.jpg)
Symbol ends with `CAD`:

    ![Screenshot](../img/datagrid/ik_ssf4.jpg)
Selected numbers:

    ![Screenshot](../img/datagrid/ik_ssf5.jpg)
Range between 10000 and 20000000:

    ![Screenshot](../img/datagrid/ik_ssf6.jpg)
Ignore null values:

    ![Screenshot](../img/datagrid/ik_ssf7.jpg)
Selecting Four symbols

    ![Screenshot](../img/datagrid/columnselection.jpg)
Range between 25 and 75

    ![Screenshot](../img/datagrid/between25and75.jpg)
Range outside 25 and 50

    ![Screenshot](../img/datagrid/outside25and50.jpg)
Return 25 and 50 only

    ![Screenshot](../img/datagrid/return25and50.jpg)

Filtering variables with `!=`

When the exclusion function `!=` is used, all values – including column cells
with null data – will be returned with the exception of the value defined by
`!=`

### Server selection filtering

Server selection should be used when data is not fully loaded to the client;
for example, when using [server-side paging](../datasources/#creating-a-data-
source) or Server-side Filtering via the _KDB Filter String_.

Server selection uses a [data source](../datasources/) to return all member
items of the filtered column.

![Screenshot](../img/datagrid/distinctvariables.jpg)

![Screenshot](../img/datagrid/distinctquery.jpg)

![Screenshot](../img/datagrid/distinctvariabledatagrid.jpg)

## Server-side filtering

Server-side filtering is not used in KX Insights Platform Views

  1. Set _Filtering_ to _Advanced Column Filters_.

  2. Create three view state parameters for _Sort Column_ , _Sort Order_ and _KDB Filter String_ ; these can be grouped in the view state parameter menu. View states for _Sort Column_ and _Sort Order_ are of _string_ or _symbol_. The _KDB Filter String_ **must** be of type _string_. 

![Screenshot](../img/datagrid/serversidefilter.jpg)

  3. Define a [data source](../datasources/) to be filtered. The following code snippet uses `dfxQuote` as the target data set; replace as appropriate: 

    
    
       {[sortCol;sortOrder;filterString]
        res:.dfilt.apply[dfxQuote; filterString];
         if[all not null (sortOrder; sortCol);
         sortOp:(`descending`ascending!(xdesc; xasc))sortOrder;
         res:sortOp[sortCol;res]
         ];
         :res;  
       }
    

    

![Screenshot](../img/datagrid/serversidefiltersetup.jpg)

A _Header Group_ defines a potential groupped header that can be applied to a
column

    

![Screenshot](../img/datagrid/headergroup.jpg)

## Custom Configuration Layout

_Ignore Custom Layout Viewstate_

    When checked, if there is a viewstate defined in the column properties then it ignores this value when applying user defined custom layouts.
_Include Hidden Columns_

    When checked, includes any hidden columns in the list of columns that can be added when applying user defined custom layouts.

## Style

[Style](../style/#component-style) for common settings

![Screenshot](../img/datagrid/datagridstylemenu.jpg)

_Header Row Height_

_Row Height_

    ![Screenshot](../img/datagrid/rowheight.jpg)
_Even Row Background_ & _Odd Row Background_

    Background colors of the even and odd rows
_Selected Row Background_

    When _Enable Row Selection_ is checked, the background color of the selected row 
_Header Text Transformation_

    Text transformation for column headers
_Header Font Weight_

    Font weight for column header
_Font Family_

    Font family for column headers and rows
_Font size_

    Font size for rows (css format), e.g. `18px`, `0.8em`, `80%`, `larger`

### Advanced CSS

[Advanced CSS](../style/#advanced-css)

## Sparklines

![Screenshot](../img/datagrid/sparklines.jpg)

To display Sparklines, set Column Format to `Sparkline` and modify `Sparkline
Options` using JSON editor

![Screenshot](../img/datagrid/jsoneditorsparklines.jpg)

Query example for Line chart `([] ix:til 100; list:{(60?30)}each 1_til 101)`

These chart types are supported: line, bar, pie, tristate, discrete, bullet,
box

### Composite sparklines

![Screenshot](../img/datagrid/compositesparklines.png)

    
    
    ([] twoDatasets: {((20?10);(20?10))}each 1_til 101)
    
    
    
    [{
        "type": "bar",
        "height": 50,
        "barWidth": 23
    },
    {
        "type": "line",
        "composite": true,
        "fillColor": "rgba(0,255,0, 0.2)",
        "lineColor": "#00ff00"
    }]
    

### Common options

These options can be set for most of the supported chart types.

option | semantics  
---|---  
type | One of `line` (default), `bar`, `tristate`, `discrete`, `bullet`, `pie` or `box`.  
width | Width of the chart: defaults to `auto`. May be any valid CSS width: 1.5em, 20px, etc. (Using a number without a unit specifier won’t do what you want.) This option does nothing for bar and tristate chars (see `barWidth`).  
height | Height of the chart. Defaults to `auto`: line height of the containing tag.  
lineColor | Used by Line and Discrete charts to specify the color of the line drawn as a CSS values string.  
fillColor | Specify the color used to fill the area under the graph as a CSS value. Set to `false` to disable fill.  
chartRangeMin | Specify the minimum value to use for the range of Y values of the chart. Defaults to the minimum value supplied.  
chartRangeMax | Specify the maximum value to use for the range of Y values of the chart. Defaults to the maximum value supplied.  
composite | If `true` then don’t erase any existing chart attached to the tag, but draw another chart over the top. Width and height are ignored if an existing chart is detected. NB: You’ll usually want to lock the axis on both charts using `chartRangeMin` and `chartRangeMax` if you want the same value on each chart to occupy the same point.  
enableTagOptions | If `true` then options can be specified as attributes on each tag to be transformed into a sparkline, as well as passed to the `sparkline()` function. See also `tagOptionPrefix`.  
tagOptionPrefix | String that each option passed as an attribute on a tag must begin with. Defaults to `spark`.  
tagValuesAttribute | The name of the tag attribute to fetch values from, if present: defaults to `values`.  
disableHiddenCheck | Set to `true` to disable checking for hidden sparklines. This can be beneficial if you know you’ll never attempt to draw a sparkline into a hidden parent element, as it avoids a browser reflow for the test, increasing rendering performance. Defaults to `false`.  
  
#### Range maps

Several parameters, such as `colorMap` and `tooltipLookupValues`, accept a
range map as a parameter. As the name suggest, it maps ranges of numbers to
values. For example:

    
    
    {
        1: "red",
        "2:9": "yellow",
        "10:": "red"
    }
    

This would map 1 to red, values of 2 through 9 (inclusive) to yellow and
values of 10 and higher to "red"

### Line charts

Line charts are the default chart type, but to specify the type explicitly set
an option called `type` to `line`.

option | semantics  
---|---  
defaultPixelsPerValue | Defaults to 3 pixels of width for each value in the chart.  
spotColor | The CSS color of the final value marker. Set to `false` or an empty string to hide it.  
minSpotColor | The CSS color of the marker displayed for the mimum value. Set to `false` or an empty string to hide it.  
maxSpotColor | The CSS color of the marker displayed for the maximum value. Set to `false` or an empty string to hide it.  
spotRadius | Radius of all spot markers, in pixels (default: 1.5).  
valueSpots | Specifies which points to draw spots on, and with which color. Accepts a range. For example, to render green spots on all values less than 50 and red on values higher use `{":49": "green", "50:": "red"}`  
highlightSpotColor | Specifies a color for the spot that appears on a value when moused over. Set to null to disable. Defaults to `#f5f`.  
highlightLineColor | Specifies a color for the vertical line that appears through a value when moused over. Set to null to disable. Defaults to `#f22`.  
lineWidth | In pixels (default: 1) – Integer  
normalRangeMin, normalRangeMax | Specify threshold values between which to draw a bar to denote the ‘normal’ or expected range of values. For example the green bar might denote a normal operating temperature range  
drawNormalOnTop | By default the normal range is drawn behind the fill area of the chart. Setting this option to `true` causes it to be drawn over the top of the fill area  
xvalues | See below  
chartRangeClip | If `true` then the Y values supplied to plot will be clipped to fall between `chartRangeMin` and `chartRangeMax`. By default `chartRangeMin/Max` just ensure that the chart spans at least that range of values, but does not constrain it.  
chartRangeMinX | Specifies the minimum X value of the chart  
chartRangeMaxX | Specifies the maximum X value of the chart  
  
See also all of the common options above, that can also be used with line
charts

By default the values supplied to line charts are presumed to be y values
mapping on to sequential (integer) X values. If you need to specify both the X
and Y values for your chart, use an array of arrays: `((1; 3); (2; 4); (5;
3))`

You can also specify a value of `null` to omit values from the chart
completely.

### Bar charts

Set the `type` option to `bar` to generate bar charts. Values can be omitted
by using the `null` value instead of a number.

option | semantics  
---|---  
barColor | CSS color used for positive values.  
negBarColor | CSS color used for negative values.  
zeroColor | CSS color used for values equal to zero.  
nullColor | CSS color used for values equal to null. By default, null values are omitted entirely, but setting this adds a thin marker for the entry. This can be useful if your chart is pretty sparse: perhaps try setting it to a light gray or something equally unobtrusive.  
barWidth | Width of each bar, in pixels (integer).  
barSpacing | Space between each bar, in pixels (integer).  
zeroAxis | Centers the Y-axis at zero if true (default).  
colorMap | A range map to map specific values to selected colors. For example if you want all values of -2 to appear yellow, use `colorMap: { "-2": "#ff0" }`. You may also pass an array of values here instead of a mapping to specify a color for each individual bar. For example if your chart has three values 1, 3, 1 you can set `colorMap=["red", "green", "blue"]`  
stackedBarColor | An array of colors to use for stacked bar charts. The first series will use the first value in the array, the second series will use the second, etc.  
  
See also all of the common options above, that can also be used with bar
charts

Version 2.0 adds support for stacked bar charts. Values for each data series
in the chart can be separated by colons if passed by HTML, or as an array of
arrays.

For example, to draw series one with values of 1,2,3,4 and series 2 with
values of 4,3,2,1: `((1; 4); (2; 3); (3; 2); (4; 1))`

### Tristate charts

`(1; 1; 0; 1; -1; -1; 1; -1; 0; 0; 1; 1)`

Tri-state charts are useful to show win-lose-draw information, such as the SF
Giants recent game results above. You can also use the `colorMap` option to
use different colors for different values, or for arbitrary positions in the
chart.

Set the `type` option to `tristate` to generate Tristate charts.

option | semantics  
---|---  
posBarColor | CSS color for positive (win) values.  
negBarColor | CSS color for negative (lose) values.  
zeroBarColor | CSS color for zero (draw) values.  
barWidth | Width of each bar, in pixels (integer).  
barSpacing | Space between each bar, in pixels (integer).  
colorMap | A range map to map specific values to selected colors. For example if you want all values of -2 to appear yellow, use `colorMap: { "-2": "#ff0" }`.  
  
As of version 1.5 you may also pass an array of values here instead of a
mapping to specifiy a color for each individual bar. For example if your chart
has three values 1, 3, 1 you can set `colorMap=["red", "green", "blue"]`.

charts

### Discrete charts

`(4; 6; 7; 7; 4; 3; 2; 1; 4; 4; 5; 6; 7; 6; 6; 2; 4; 5)`

Discrete charts provide a separated thin vertical line for each value.

Set the `type` option to `discrete` to generate Discrete charts.

option | semantics  
---|---  
lineHeight | Height of each line in pixels. Defaults to 30% of the graph height.  
thresholdValue | Values less than this value will be drawn using `thresholdColor` instead of `lineColor`  
thresholdColor | Color to use in combination with thresholdvalue`.  
  
See also all of the common options above, that can also be used with discrete
charts

### Bullet graphs

[Bullet Graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_graph "Wikipedia")

Supplied values must be in this order: target, performance, range 1, range 2,
range 3, …

Set the `type` option to `bullet` to generate Bullet graphs.

option | semantics  
---|---  
targetColor | The CSS color of the vertical target marker.  
targetWidth | The width of the target marker in pixels (integer).  
performanceColor | The CSS color of the performance measure horizontal bar  
rangeColors | Colors to use for each qualitative range background color. This must be a JavaScript array, e.g. `["red","green", "#22f"]`.  
  
See also all of the common options above, that can also be used with bullet
charts

### Pie charts

Set the `type` option to `pie` to generate Pie charts.

These little pie charts tend only to be useful only with 2 or 3 values at
most.

option | semantics  
---|---  
sliceColors | An array of CSS colors to use for pie slices.  
offset | Angle in degrees to offset the first slice. Try -90 or +90.  
borderWidth | Width of the border to draw around the whole chart, in pixels. Defaults to 0 (no border).  
borderColor | CSS color to use to draw the pie border. Defaults to #000.  
  
See also all of the common options above, that can also be used with Pie
charts

### Box plots

`(4; 27; 34; 52; 54; 59; 61; 68; 78; 82; 85; 87; 91; 93; 100)`

[Box Plots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_plot "Wikipedia")

Set the `type` option to `box` to generate Box plots.

option | semantics  
---|---  
raw | If set to `false` (default) then the values supplied are used to calculate the box data points for you. If `true` then you must pre-calculate the points (see below).  
showOutliers | If `true` (default) then outliers (values > 1.5 × the IQR) are marked with circles and the whiskers are placed at Q1 and Q3 instead of the least and greatest value.  
outlierIQR | Set the inter-quartile range multipler used to calculate values that qualify as an outlier. Defaults to 1.5.  
boxLineColor | CSS line color used to outline the box.  
boxFillColor | CSS fill color used for the box.  
whiskerColor | CSS color used to draw the whiskers.  
outlierLineColor | CSS color used to draw the outlier circles.  
outlierFillColor | CSS color used to fill the outlier circles.  
spotRadius | Radius in pixels to draw the outlier circles.  
medianColor | CSS color used to draw the median line.  
target | If set to a value, then a small crosshair is drawn at that point to represent a target value.  
targetColor | CSS color used to draw the target crosshair, if set.  
minValue | If `minvalue` and `maxvalue` are set then the scale of the plot is fixed. By default `minValue` and `maxValue` are deduced from the values supplied.  
maxValue | See `minValue`.  
  
See also all of the common options above, that can also be used with Box plot
charts

As noted in the options above, by default `raw` is set to `false`. This means
that you can just pass an arbitrarily long list of values to the sparkline
function and the corresponding box plot will be calculated from those values.
This is probably the behavior you want most of the time.

If, on the other hand, you have thousands of values to deal with you may want
to pre-compute the points needed for the Box plot. In that case, set
`raw=true` and pass in the computed values. If showing outliers, supplied
values of:  
`low_outlier`, `low_whisker`, `q1`, `median`, `q3`, `high_whisker`,
`high_outlier`. Omit the outliers and set `showOutliers` to `false` to omit
outlier display.

### Interactive sparklines

Version 2.0 of the plugin introduces support for interactive sparklines in the
form of tooltips, mouseover highlighting and click interaction for all
supported types of sparkline.

If you’re happy with the default look and feel of the tooltips, you can skip
this entire section.

Options to control sparkline interactions:

option | semantics  
---|---  
disableInteraction | Set to `true` to disable all sparkline interactivity, making the plugin behave in much the same way as it did in 1.x Defaults to `false`.  
disableTooltips | Set to `true` to disable mouseover tooltips. Defaults to `false`.  
disableHighlight | Set to `true` to disable the highlighting of individual values when mousing over a sparkline. Defaults to `false`.  
highlightLighten | Controls the amount to lighten or darken a value when moused over. A value of 1.5 will lighten by 50%, 0.5 will darken by 50%. Defaults to 1.4.  
highlightColor | If specified, then values that are moused over will be changed to this color instead of being lightened.  
tooltipClassname | Specifies a CSS class name to apply to tooltips to override the default built-in style.  
tooltipOffsetX | Specifies how many pixels away from the mouse pointer to render the tooltip on the X axis.  
tooltipOffsetY | Specifies how many pixels away from the mouse pointer to render the tooltip on the Y axis.  
tooltipChartTitle | If specified then the tooltip uses the string specified by this setting as a title.  
tooltipFormat | A format string or spformat object (or an array thereof for multiple entries) to control the format of the tooltip.  
tooltipPrefix | A string to prepend to each field displayed in a tooltip.  
tooltipSuffix | A string to append to each field displayed in a tooltip.  
tooltipSkipNull | If `true` then null values will not have a tooltip displayed Defaults to `true`.  
tooltipValueLookups | An object or range map to map field values to tooltip strings. For example you may want to map -1, 0 and 1 to the strings `Lost`, `Draw`, `Won`.  
tooltipFormatFieldlist | An array of values specifying which fields to display in a tooltip and in what order. Currently only useful for Box plots. See below for more details.  
tooltipFormatFieldlistKey | Specifies which key holds the field name to reference above. For Box plots this should be `field`.  
numberFormatter | Pass a JavaScript function to control how numbers are formatted in tooltips. The callback will be passed a number to format and must return a string. Default behavior is to format numbers to Western conventions.  
numberDigitGroupSep | Character to use for group separator in numbers `1,234` for [L10n](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization "Wikipedia") purposes. Defaults to the comma `,`.  
numberDecimalMark | Character to use for the decimal point in numbers for L10n purposes. Defaults to the period `.`.  
numberDigitGroupCount | Number of digits between the group seperator in numbers for L10n purposes. Defaults to 3.  
  
The `tooltipFormat` and `tooltipValueLookups` options provide the main methods
of formatting the text displayed for each value in a toolip.

The `tooltipFormat` is applied whenever the mouse is moved over a value.
Various fields enclosed between double curly braces in the format string are
substituted depending on the type of sparkline in use. For example, the
default format string for line charts is:

    
    
    {{prefix}}{{y}}{{suffix}}
    

`color` is derived from the color of the line being drawn.  
`prefix` and `suffix` and set by setting the `tooltipPrefix` and
`tooltipSuffix` items.  
`y` represents the Y value of the point under the mouse. `x` can also be used
if useful.

The supported fields for the different types of sparklines include:

  * **All types:** `prefix`, `suffix` as set by `tooltipPrefix` and `tooltipSuffix` options
  * **Line:** `color`, `fillColor`, `x`, `y`, `isNull` (true if a null value)
  * **Bar:** `value` (the value under the pointer), `color`, `isNull`
  * **Tristate:** `value` (the value under the pointer), `color`, `isNull`
  * **Discrete:** `value`, `isNull`
  * **Pie:** `value`, `percent` (number between 0 and 100), `color` (of the moused-over slice)`
  * **Bullet:** `value`, `fieldkey`, `isNull`
  * **Box:** `field` and `value`. Field may be one of `lq` (lower quartile), `med` (median), `uq` (upper quartile), `lo` (left outlier), `ro` (right outlier), `lw` (left whisker) `rw` (right whisker)
