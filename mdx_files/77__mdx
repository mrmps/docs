# Loading libraries - KX Developer

Original URL: https://code.kx.com/developer/libraries-setup/

# Running libraries

Some of the public libraries in Developer can be run externally outside the
UI. A separate archive of the libraries is included within the primary
Developer `.zip` file, named `axlibraries.zip`. A `README.md` is included
within the `axlibraries.zip` archive with installation instructions.

## Loading in native q

Once the installation is set up, ensure the following environment variables
are set correctly.

Variable | Location | Optional  
---|---|---  
`QHOME` | Directory containing q.k |   
`QLIC` | Directory of q license file |   
`AXLIBRARIES_HOME` | Path to the `ax-libraries` directory |   
`AXIMPORT_PATH` | Colon separated paths from which q files can be imported | âœ“  
  
Once these variables are set, the libraries can be loaded into a native q
process in the following way (substituting `<library>` with the library of
your choice):

    
    
    q $AXLIBRARIES_HOME/ws/<library>.q_
    

**Loading Multiple libraries in Native q**

To load multiple libraries one can use either of the equivalent methods below
(substituting `<library>` with the library of your choice):

    
    
    q
    q)system "l ",getenv[`AXLIBRARIES_HOME],"/ws/<library>.q_"
    
    
    
    q
    q)\l $AXLIBRARIES_HOME/ws/<library>.q_
