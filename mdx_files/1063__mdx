# Intraday database

The intraday historical database (_IHDB_) is used to store intraday data of
the current day. Generally this is used for tables with large data volumes.
Data saved in the _IHDB_ will already be partitioned by sym and sorted by
time. At the end of day, all data will be written down to the _HDB_ and
deleted from the _IHDB_.
