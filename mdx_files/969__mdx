# Core affinity

## Linux CPU afinity configuration

kdb+ is typically licensed to run on a number of CPU cores. By default the q
binary will be run under taskset on Linux. On some Linux systems there is also
the option of running kdb+ under numactl (if enabled).

### Affinity command

CPU cores can be identified via an integer on Linux see below:

CPU ID | Value  
---|---  
CPU0 | 0  
CPU1 | 1  
CPU2 | 2  
CPU3 | 3  
CPU4 | 4  
CPU5 | 5  
CPU6 | 6  
CPU7 | 7  
  
Typically we use taskset to give a process a range of cores it can run on. For
example on an 8 core box you can specify a taskset that uses 1/2 the available
cores using the mask 0-3 or 4-7.

Another aim of task setting is to protect critical processes from being
swapped out by other processes on the same box, this can be achieved by task
setting the critical process to a given core and omitting that core in all
other taskset ranges. Kdb+ is single threaded so when it is taskset to a range
of cores the OS scheduler will assign it one core from that range. Java
processes are typically multi threaded and can make use of multiple cores
inside a taskset range.

### KX Control

KX Control is a kdb+ process which is run under taskset. The taskset value it
uses is defined by the KDB_CPU_AFFINITY environment variable in the
delta.profile.

The value of KDB_CPU_AFFINITY can be configured at install time as follows:

The bundle installer will prompt for the number of licensed kdb+ cores, the
value you give will result in a taskset range for the same number of cores.
e.g. if you enter 10 below:

    
    
    Number of [Licensed KDB+] [CPU cores] [Max: 12]: 10
    

This will result in KDB_CPU_AFFINITY being set to core 0 and the process
instance taskset values being set to 1-9. This effectively gives KX Control
its own core.

The value of KDB_CPU_AFFINITY can be configured in and install.config which
can be passed to the installKxPlatform.sh script (via -p) as follows:

    
    
    kdb-cpu-affinity=0-9
    

The above setting will set KDB_CPU_AFFINITY to 0-9 in delta.profile

### Daemon

The Daemon is a Java process which is used to start processes on remote boxes,
i.e. on boxes which are not running KX Control. The taskset value is uses is
defined by the DCD_CPU_AFFINITY environment variable in the delta.profile.

The value of DCD_CPU_AFFINITY can be configured at install time as follows:

The bundle installer will automatically set the taskset value to 0 meaning the
Daemon will run on core 0 on the box.

The value of DCD_CPU_AFFINITY can be configured in and install.config which
can be passed to the installKxPlatform.sh script (via -p) as follows:

    
    
    dcd-cpu-affinity=0-9
    

The above setting will set DCD_CPU_AFFINITY to 0-9 in delta.profile

### Process instance

Platform process instances can be kicked off in a couple of ways in the KX
Delta Platform.

If the instance is configured to run on the same node as the leader _KX
Control_ process then it will be started by KX Control.

#### No affinity defined

If no taskset value is configured for the instance it will inherit the value
of KDB_CPU_AFFINITY see below:

KX Control is configured to run on cores 0-4.

    
    
    $ grep KDB_CPU_AFFINITY delta.profile
    export KDB_CPU_AFFINITY="0-4"
    

Start Control and check the taskset value using Control's PID as given by the
start script.

    
    
    $ ./startDeltaControl.sh
    Sourcing [../delta.profile]
    Sourcing [../delta_user.profile]
    Sourcing [../delta.instance.profile]
    KDB+ license valid
    Setting CPU Affinity using [taskset -c 0-4]
    Starting Control 4.4.1 on port 2001 using KDB+ 3.6.0
    Control [PID:68643] started successfully
    
    $ taskset -cp 68643
    pid 68643's current affinity list: 0-4
    

The Messaging server process (ds_ms_a) has now taskset value configured see
below:

    
    
    $ grep ds_ms_a_TASKSET delta.instance.profile
    export ds_ms_a_TASKSET=""
    

If we start the process via KX Control and check its taskset value it should
match that of KDB_CPU_AFFINITY

    
    
    $ ./startProcessInstance.sh -i ds_ms_a
    $ ps -ef | grep ds_ms_a | grep -v grep | awk '{print $2}'
    72847
    $ taskset -cp 72847
    pid 72847's current affinity list: 0-4
    

You can see the affinity list matches that of KDB_CPU_AFFINITY

**Note** : if the process was started via the Daemon on a remote box it would
inherit the value of the DCD_CPU_AFFINITY environment variable.

#### Define process affinity

The affinity for a process instance can be configured through its TASKSET
value in the delta.instance.profile.

##### Auto configuration

This can be configured automatically at deploy time using a custom config
which specifies a taskset value to be used for *_all_ instances.

    
    
    auto-configure-instance-taskset=1-4
    

The setting above will mean that every process instance in the
delta.instance.profile gets the taskset value 1-4 see below

    
    
    export ds_ms_a_HOST="control-a.fd.com"
    export ds_ms_a_PORT="3019"
    export ds_ms_a_TASKSET=""
    export ds_ms_b_HOST="NO_HOST_SET"
    export ds_ms_b_PORT="3019"
    export ds_ms_b_TASKSET="1-4"
    export ds_qm_at_a_HOST="control-a.fd.com"
    export ds_qm_at_a_PORT="3020"
    export ds_qm_at_a_TASKSET="1-4"
    export ds_qm_at_b_HOST="NO_HOST_SET"
    export ds_qm_at_b_PORT="3020"
    export ds_qm_at_b_TASKSET="1-4"
    export ds_qm_ops_a_HOST="control-a.fd.com"
    export ds_qm_ops_a_PORT="3021"
    export ds_qm_ops_a_TASKSET="1-4"
    export ds_qm_ops_b_HOST="NO_HOST_SET"
    export ds_qm_ops_b_PORT="3021"
    export ds_qm_ops_b_TASKSET="1-4"
    

##### CSV configuration

If you want to specify taskset values for specific instances this can be done
using an instance.csv file which is used to configure the host/port/taskset
values for a given set of process instances.

This file is passed into the `install.sh` or `installKxPlatform.sh` using the
(-i instance.csv) flag.

Any instances not configured via the instance.csv will be configured using the
`auto-configure-instance-taskset` above.

For example if we want our Messaging Server ds_ms_a process above to run on
our KX Control host (control-a.fd.com) on port 5010 and using taskset 7-8 then
we would have the following in our instance.csv.

    
    
    ds_ms_a,control-a.fd.com,5010,7-8
    

If we then deploy using this file we will see that the ds_ms_a value in
delta.instance.profile looks like this

    
    
    $ grep ds_ms_a_TASKSET delta.instance.profile
    export ds_ms_a_TASKSET="7-8"
    

Now if we start the process instance and check the taskset value:

    
    
    $ ./startProcessInstance.sh -i ds_ms_a
    $ ps -ef | grep ds_ms_a | grep -v grep | awk '{print $2}'
    101456
    $ taskset -cp 101456
    pid 101456's current affinity list: 7,8
    

You can see the process instance taskset is different from the value of
KDB_CPU_AFFINITY.

### Numactl

If Numactl is available on your host you can use it in place of taskset by
installing with a custom install.config file. The following options will
configure the KX Delta Platform to use numactl

    
    
    cpu-affinity-cmd=numactl --interleave=all --physcpubind=
    

The result is that the CPU_AFFINITY_CMD in delta.profile becomes "numactl
--interleave=all --physcpubind="

The process for setting core affinity for Control, Daemon and instances is the
same as that for taskset above.

There is one caveat however, when running with numactl any process instances
kicked off by Control or the Daemon can only use all or a subset of the CPU
cores defined by KDB_CPU_AFFINITY (KX Control) and DCD_CPU_AFFINITY (Daemon)

If the process instance is configured to use cores outside of this range you
will see the following in the process instance log file (`delta-
data/DeltaControlData/logdir/<process.instance.log>`)

    
    
    libnuma: Warning: cpu argument X out of range
    

For this reason it is recommended that the auto-configure-instance-taskset
values match those of dcd-cpu-affinity=0-9 and kdb-cpu-affinity=0-9 or use a
subset e.g. auto-configure-instance-taskset=0-3

    
    
    cpu-affinity-cmd=numactl --interleave=all --physcpubind=
    dcd-cpu-affinity=0-9
    kdb-cpu-affinity=0-9
    auto-configure-instance-taskset=0-9
    

With the configuration above KX Control being started using numactl as
follows:

    
    
    numactl --interleave=all --physcpubind=0-9 q q/centralconfig.q_ …
    

The Daemon will also be run under numactl as follows:

    
    
    numactl --interleave=all --physcpubind=0-9 ./run.sh
    

### Bundle installation taskset

When installing the _KX Delta Platform_ from a bundle (`install.sh`), you will
be prompt to choose the amount of cores the application should use, this is
generally the total amount of cores on the server, or the amount of cores you
are licensed to use.

    
    
    Number of [Licensed KDB+] [CPU cores] [Max: 12]: 12
    

The Bundle installer will automatically assign the Control and Daemon
processes to core 0. This is to reduce the impact on process instances during
spikes in Control CPU usage during housekeeping tasks.

    
    
    export KDB_CPU_AFFINITY="0"
    export DCD_CPU_AFFINITY="0"
    

The remaining Control processes will be spread across the remaining cores.

    
    
    export ds_gw_ops_a_TASKSET="1-11"
    

## Windows CPU affinity configuration

Kdb+ is typically licensed to run on a number of CPU cores. By default the q
binary will be run under /affinity on Windows.

### Affinity settings

Delta Control, daemons and process instances can all have their own affinity
settings.

  * KDB_CPU_AFFINITY (configured in delta.profile.bat) assigns the KX Control process to specific cores
  * DCD_CPU_AFFINITY (configured in delta.profile.bat) assigns daemons to specific cores

On Windows the CPU affinity list is configured using a hexadecimal mask
detailed in the table below:

CPU ID | Associated Value | Affinity (Hexadecimal Value)  
---|---|---  
CPU0 | 1 | 1  
CPU1 | 2 | 3  
CPU2 | 4 | 7  
CPU3 | 8 | F  
CPU4 | 16 | 1F  
CPU5 | 32 | 3F  
CPU6 | 64 | 7F  
CPU7 | 128 | FF  
  
### Available CPU cores

To check the number of available CPU cores on your machine open the Task
Manager and select Performance and then select Open Resource Monitor at the
bottom of the Task Manager.

![Screenshot](../img/win-cores-taskmanager.png)

When we open the resource monitor we need to navigate to the CPU by selecting
the CPU tab. On the right side of the screen we can see how many available
CPU’s can be used. In this example we can see there are 8 (CPU 0 - CPU 7).

![Screenshot](../img/win-cores-resource-monitor.png)

### Default configuration

By default Windows deploys are configured to use a single core for KX Control
and the Daemon. If you look at delta.profile.bat you will see:

    
    
    set KDB_CPU_AFFINITY=1
    set DCD_CPU_AFFINITY=1
    

If we run our deploy again using startup.bat the Java™ SE Binary and q.exe
processes will be run as normal. If we click on Details at the top of the Task
Manager and select any of the deploy processes, we can right click on the
process and select Set Affinity, this will show that the process is running on
only CPU 0.

![Screenshot](../img/single-core-windows.png)

### Multiple cores

To run on multiple cores we first of all need to shut the deploy see [Windows
Administration](../win_administration/), we can then edit our
delta.profile.bat to change the value of our `KDB_CPU_AFFINITY` and
`DCD_CPU_AFFINITY`.

The table above shows the hexadecimal value that is associated with each CPU
component e.g. to use 5 CPU’s the value is 1F.

#### Changing the KDB_CPU_AFFINITY

The `KDB_CPU_AFFINITY` assigns Control processes to specific cores using a
hexadecimal mask; if we edit our delta.profile.bat and navigate to the
`KDB_CPU_AFFINITY` (use the search function in Notepad to find it quickly) we
can change the value from 1 to 1F as shown below:

    
    
    set KDB_CPU_AFFINITY=1F
    set DCD_CPU_AFFINITY=1
    

This means that all Control processes will now run on 5 CPU cores rather than
just 1 as previous. If we start-up our deploy again we can go to the task
manager to show this.

Select the `q q/centralconfig.q` process, right click and select set affinity
we can now see that CPU 0 – CPU 4 are now selected showing that the Control
processes are now running across 5 different CPU cores.

![Screenshot](../img/5-cores-windows.png)

#### Changing the DCD_CPU_AFFINITY

The `DCD_CPU_AFFINITY` assigns daemons to cores using a hexadecimal mask; if
we edit our delta.profile.bat and navigate back to our `DCD_CPU_AFFINITY` we
can change the value from 1 to F. From the table above we can see that a value
of F should mean that the daemons will be run across 4 cores instead of 1.

    
    
    set KDB_CPU_AFFINITY=1
    set DCD_CPU_AFFINITY=F
    

Now restart your environment (see [here](../win_administration/) and select
the `ds_ms_a` process in the task manager, right click and select set affinity
we can now see that CPU 0 – CPU 3 are now selected showing that the Control
processes are now running across 4 different CPU cores.

![Screenshot](../img/4-cores-windows.png)

#### Process instances

Process instances (configured in the delta.instance.profile.bat) can be set to
specific cores using TASKSET environment variables associated with each
individual process (e.g. ds_qp_a_TASKSET). If a process doesn’t have a
specific value set, they will inherit the daemons affinity settings

Process instance affinities use the Linux taskset style, for example for core
1 only "1" would be used, for Cores 1,2,3 and 4 taskset value would be "1-4"
or "1,2,3,4". For cores 1, 2, 3 and 5 the taskset value would be "1-3, 5".
These values can be changed manually or configured using the
`updateProcessInstances.bat` script.
