# Licenses - KX Delta Platform

Original URL: https://code.kx.com/platform/deployment/licenses/

# Licenses

Running the _KX Delta Platform_ requires 2 license files.

License | Descriptions  
---|---  
k4.lic | kdb+ license  
.delta.lic | KX Delta Platform license  
  
Then _KX Delta Platform_ runs on kdb+ and so requires a kdb+ license file
(k4.lic/kc.lic). For more details on the kdb+ license, see
[code.kx](https://code.kx.com/q/learn/licensing/)

The _KX Delta Platform_ itself is licensed separately via the (.delta.lic)
which enables certain features of KX Delta Platform.

For access to license files, if you are an existing client kindly contact your
KX Account Rep copying [licadmin@kx.com](mailto:licadmin@kx.com)

## Deploying license files

License files are required in order to deploy and run the _KX Delta Platform_.
kdb+ and KX Delta Platform licenses are tied to either a hostname (e.g.
host.firstderivatives.com) or a domain name (firstderivatives.com). The kdb+
license is typically restricted to a number of CPU cores.

  * Linux license files are prompted for by the installer.
  * Windows license files are manually copied into the config directory (`<deploy-dir>/delta-bin/config`)
  * To use a kc.lic instead of the default k4.lic set the `use-kc-lic` option at install, see [install options](../install_config_options/#General-options)
