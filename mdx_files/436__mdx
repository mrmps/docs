_Highlight rules in operation in a Data Grid_

Highlight rules are a common property utilizing color and/or icon markers to
notify users of value changes and are best used with real-time streaming or
polling data.

_Name_

    Assign a name for your rule
_Target_

    The _Data Source_ column updated when the rule is true
_Condition Source_

    The _Data Source_ column monitored by the _Condition Operator_ against the _Condition Value_
_Condition Operator_

    

may be a numeric comparison, but can also test for strings in text values

operator | explanation  
---|---  
search | find _Condition Value_ match; assign [View State Parameter](../viewstateparameters/) and pair with [Text Input](../textinput/).  
contains | find all instances with the _Condition Value_  
starts with | find all instances starting with the _Condition Value_  
ends with | find all instance ending with the _Condition Value_  
== | exact match, e.g. client name  
< | less than _Condition Value_  
> | greater than _Condition Value_  
<= | less than or equal to _Condition Value_  
>= | greater than or equal to _Condition Value_  
!= | excludes _Condition Value_  
_Condition Value_

    Typically `previous value`. Can also be mapped to a [View State Parameter](../viewstateparameters/). _Condition Value_ can either be a numeric or text value; e.g. if searching for a client name from a list of clients in a [Data Grid](../datagrid/) column.
_Color_

    Text color changed by rule when true
_Background Color_

    _Data Grid_ cell background or _Canvas Chart_ bar or point changed by rule when true
_Border Color_

    _Data Grid_ cell border or _Canvas Chart_ bar or point border changed by rule when true
_Icon_

_Icon Color_

    For _Data Grid_ , icon appears when rule is true.
