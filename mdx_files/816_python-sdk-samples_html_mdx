## Running the sample

To upload the `sample.csv` file, use the following command:

    
    
    python3 csvupload.py --config <config URL> --dir <RT directory>
    

The `--config` argument can be either:

  * a _kdb Insights Enterprise_ client URL or
  * a URL to a local JSON file (`file://...`) containing the RT configuration.

See the [Getting Started](getting-started-sdks.html#authentication-and-
connectivity) section for further information.

The `--dir` argument is the path to RT log directory.

The program will upload the `sample.csv` file and then exit.
