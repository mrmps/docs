# Entity subscriptions

Entities stored in _KX Control_ are often loaded into processes and used
during runtime. The entity payload is usually downloaded on initialization and
cached for re-use. In certain circumstances, the entity might get updated in
_KX Control_ and the process would then be using an out-of-date version.

When a change goes through the _KX Control_ versioning, the updated version
will be pushed to any subscribed processes. A subscription framework is
bundled with the template API so processes can subscribe for these changes and
update the locally-cached versions.

Subscriptions can be managed by entity or by class. The subscription functions
use the keyword ``ALL` to subscribe to every entity for a given class. The
Template API documentation describes the various APIs in detail.

Bulk and single-accessor APIs exist for each entity class. The supported
entity classes are:

  * `instance`
  * `analytic`
  * `dataconnectiongroup`
  * `connection`
  * `user`
  * `email`
  * `emaillist`
