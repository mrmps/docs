# Prerequisites

Before installing kdb Insights Enterprise on Azure, you need the following:

  * **Permissions** : Please refer to the [Permissions Guidelines](kx-managed-app-permissions.html).

  * **Availability zones** : Ensure that you choose an Azure Region with [Availability Zones](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/availability-zones/az-overview#azure-regions-with-availability-zones).

Availability zones and Reliable Transport

By default, the kdb Insights Enterprise deployment runs across 3 Availability
Zones (AZ) for higher resilience. The [Reliable Transport
component](../architecture.html) (RT) runs across 3 different RT nodes, but
each RT node is not set to run in distinct Availability Zones due to
performance considerations. If you want each RT node to run in a different
Availability Zones, you can set the [service affinity
configuration](../configuration/availability.html) to ensure maximum
resiliency.

  * **IP resources** : The pre-requisites depend on your network connectivity choices as described [here](security.html#ip-address-configuration):

    * Private IP addresses: see the details [here](security.html#private-ip-address) on how to allow clients access to the UI and the API endpoints.
    * Public IP address: see details [here](security.html#public-ip-address).
  * **Required Resource Providers** : the Resource Providers listed below must be registered in the subscription; if you are missing any of them, your deployment can fail.

To learn how to register resource providers, follow [Microsoft
Guidance](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-
manager/management/resource-providers-and-types#register-resource-provider).
