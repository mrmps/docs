# DNS setup

A DNS record is required by kdb Insights Enterprise to setup ingress and allow
external clients to access the application. This typically requires a
subdomain being set up against an owned domain and registered with an
appropriate DNS provider. The ability to do this is beyond the scope of the
kdb Insights Enterprise but well documented on the various cloud providers.

Once the subdomain zone has been registered and setup a record can be added to
point to the kdb Insights Enterprise deployment. This URL should point to the
public IP address/hostname of the ingress controller which can be retrieved
using the command below.

    
    
    kubectl get svc ingress-nginx-controller -n ingress-nginx
    

Record type

If the ingress controller reports a public IP address, create an A record. If
a hostname is reported (typically in AWS) define a CNAME record.
