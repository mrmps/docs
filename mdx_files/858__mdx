# Service class management

## Create service class

  1. From the _File_ menu, pick _New Service Class_

  2. Give the service class a name; e.g. `FileWatcher_ServiceClass`

  3. Associate it with a package

  4. Select the `DS_FILEWATCHER` template

  5. Press the `Add` button to create it

  6. In the _Details_ tab, the description can be changed and the cluster mode set to `DEFAULT`, `LEADER_CLUSTER`, or `ROUND_ROBIN`. Save the new Service class.

  7. The _Alerts_ tab can be used to set the expected actions to take for Normal and Unexpected shutdowns, or Heartbeat timeouts.

  8. The _Reserved Params_ tab can be used to set various reserved parameters. Unlike instances, the `host`, `port`. and `taskset` are not configured here. They can be assigned automatically or overriden when the service is run.

  9. The _Service Params_ tab shows the same parameters as seen for an instance.

  10. The _History_ tab shows all the past and current running services for the class. The names may be the auto-generated ones or any name manually entered when running the Service class. There may be multiple instances running at one time.

Uniqueness

Service class names must be unique with respect to instances and connection
groups. A service class can't be created using the same name as an instance or
connection group and vice versa.

## Other considerations

Service classes are **versioned** , **packaged** , included in **checkpoints**
, and are handled like any other entity type.

**Non-admin** users can interact with services and service classes by being
given entitlements for the `UxProcess`, `UxInterrogation` and `UxRuntime`
roles.
