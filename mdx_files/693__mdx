# Packaging - KX Delta Platform

# Packaging

_KX Control_ contains a complete import/export facility to support deployment
between environments. The package structure contains a definition file and a
series of content files separated into different directories based on the
entity class.

So far we've grouped everything we created into the `KxWarehouse` package.
This can be pushed to Git for versioning and integration with deployment and
testing pipelines.

### Git commit

The package pushed directly to Git using the _Package Exporter_.

Repo creation

When pushing packages to Git, the repository needs to be pre-created manually
on the Git server.

  * Right-click on the `KxWarehouse` package and select _Open Package Exporter_ from the context menu.

  * A new tab opens with a list of all the entities in the package. Add the remote git location to _Git info_.

  * In the _Package Exporter_ uncheck `Include Child Dependencies`.

  * Check `Include Permissions`. This means the permissions are automatically exported which will allow the set up of the same user groups, users and permissioning levels when a package is imported.

  * Click on `Git commit/push`.

    * The _Git Commit_ tab lists the staged changes. Add a commit message here.
    * The _Content Diff_ allows you to diff the changes to be committed.
  * Upon checking if the repository, branch and staged files are correct, click on _Commit_ to push the package directly to Git.

### Export to disk

Packages may be exported to disk in a similar manner.

  * In _Package Exporter_ , make sure to specify the _Directory_.
  * Click on `Export All` to save onto disk.

See below for further documentation:

[Exporting Packages](../../release_management/#package-exporter)

### Import from disk

Packages can be imported from disk using the _Package Importer_.

  * In _Package Importer_ , you can import the zip file of the previously exported package or you can import from disk if package already there.
