# 4.1.0 - KX Delta Platform

Original URL: https://code.kx.com/platform/stream/release_410/

# Changes in 4.1.0

## Messaging

### Multi-publish

Ability to publish multiple tables in a single message

### Reconnects

Components will attempt to re-establish subscriptions after losing a
connection

### Clustering

Messaging servers can be configured in a cluster so only the leader accepts
registrations. In previous versions without clustering, during failover
scenarios two components can register with different servers and no matching
occurs.

Clustering is disabled by default but can be enabled via the `serverCluster`
instance parameter of the messaging server instances. The override selected
should match that of any messaging components connecting.

### Event callbacks

There are callbacks for a range of messaging events on sources and consumers.
By default they are set to do nothing.

Kdb+ processes can act as a client of the report generator, and run reports
programmatically. Communication with the report generator is by way of the
Query Router.

## Miscellaneous

### Action tracker

Permissions governed from entity group. Easier setup with LDAP groups;
eliminates manual permissioning step

## Java email

Supports ENV-based configuration: `Host`, `port`, `fromAddress`
