# MQTT - KX Delta Platform

Original URL: https://code.kx.com/platform/mqtt/

# MQTT integration

KX Delta Platform offers direct integration with MQTT through a KX Delta
Platform asset package. It offers the full functionality available detailed at
[code.kx.com](https://code.kx.com/q/wp/iot-mqtt/#install-the-kx-mqtt-
interface).

Currently all Linux flavours supported by the KX Delta Platform support MQTT
integration including Ubuntu 16/18 and Red Hat 7/8.

## KxMqtt prerequisites

Please ensure that you have [MQTT C
API](https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.c/releases) paho libraries installed
on your server and mosquito installed to test publishing and subscribing to
MQTT topics.

The only other requirement is the ability to update the `$QHOME` with the
necessary libraries and Kdb+ script wrapper as part of the KX Delta Platform
installation.

## KX Delta Platform KxMqtt asset installation

The KxMqtt KX Delta Platform asset is installed in the same way as all KX
Delta Platform, KX Delta Platform asset and Solution packages are installed.
Place the package in the relevant package directory and run through the
installation script. Further details on KX Delta Platform and package
deployment can be retrieved via the [Deployment
guides](https://nexus.firstderivatives.com/nexus/content/repositories/KxDocs/DeploymentGuides/)

## KxMqtt KX Analyst integration

KxMqtt is fully integrated with the KX Analyst component of the KX Delta
Platform.
