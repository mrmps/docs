Original URL: https://code.kx.com/insights/enterprise/cli/index.html

# Command line interface overview

The kdb Insights Command Line Interface is a tool to manage your kdb Insights
Enterprise application. Use it to:

  * **Manage deployments**

You can install, upgrade, and uninstall kdb Insights Enterprise.

Refer to [kdb Insights Enterprise installation](../installation/insights.html)
for more information.

  * **Manage assemblies**

You can programmatically create, manage and teardown assemblies.

This functionality is available through the `kxi assembly` subcommand.

Deprecation of deployment with assembly yaml files

The deployment of assembly yaml files using the `kxi assembly` command in the
kdb Insights CLI has been deprecated and may be removed from future releases.
You should instead use packages, which can be deployed and managed by both the
UI and the kdb Insights CLI. For more information about packages, refer to
[Packages](../packaging/index.html).

  * **Manage packages**

You can create and manage packages that enable you to manage the life cycle of
deployments and custom logic in kdb Insights Enterprise.

For more information, refer to [Packaging](../packaging/index.html).

  * **Azure**

You can interact with kdb Insights Enterprise on the Azure Marketplace.

For more information on how to use the CLI with Azure, refer to [kdb Insights
Enterprise on Azure Marketplace](../azure-marketplace/index.html).

## Installing the CLI

To install the CLI, use the [CLI installation guide](install.html).

## Options precedence

The CLI reads each option value in the following order of precedence:

  1. [The command line parameter](../kxi-cli/cli.html)
  2. The value set in your local [cli-config file](configuration.html)
  3. The setting from the [values file](../configuration/index.html) passed with `--filepath` (in the case of `kxi install run/upgrade`)
  4. The setting from the [values file already deployed on cluster](../kxi-cli/cli.html#kxi-install-get-values) (in the case of `kxi install upgrade`)
  5. The response to a user prompt (in an interactive session)
  6. [The default value](configuration.html)

### Namespace precedence

The namespace option precedence has an extra check and is read in the
following order:

  1. [The `--namespace` command line parameter](../kxi-cli/cli.html)
  2. The `namespace` value set in your local [cli-config file](configuration.html)
  3. The namespace set in your active [Kubernetes context](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/)
  4. The response to a user prompt (in an interactive session)
  5. [The default value](configuration.html)
