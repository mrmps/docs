# Realtime database

The traditional realtime database (_RDB_) captures all the data from the
tickerplant and stores it in memory until the end of day, when it writes all
of its data to disk and reloads the _HDB_.

However, with increasing data volumes, it is unrealistic to store an entire
day's data in-memory. One of the solutions is to have a _Log Replay_ process
(_LR_) write data to disk (_IHDB_) periodically and release memory space.

  * To create an _RDB_ , right-click on the _Navigation panel_ in the `KxWarehouse` Package and select _New > Service Class_ from the context menu.
