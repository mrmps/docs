# kdb Insights Packaging APIs

The kdb Insights packaging functionality described here is the mechanism by
which you can create, modify and introduce databases, pipelines, reports and
code into _kdb Insights Enterprise_. For more information on packages, refer
to [Packages](../../enterprise/packaging/index.html).

There are four principal means by which you can interact with a package:

  * [Command Line Interface](../../enterprise/packaging/package-cli.html) \- Enables you to create packages, work with them locally and upload to _kdb Insights Enterprise_.
  * [q API](q/index.html) \- Allows you to interact with packages locally or within a _kdb Insights Enterprise_ installation using q.
  * [Python API](python/index.html) \- Allows you to interact with packages locally or within a _kdb Insights Enterprise_ installation using Python.
  * [Open API](openapi.html) \- Allows you to interact with packages locally or within a _kdb Insights Enterprise_ installation using REST.

Follow the quickstart guide [here](../../enterprise/packaging/quickstart.html)
for details on how to build, manage and deploy packages to _kdb Insights
Enterprise_.
