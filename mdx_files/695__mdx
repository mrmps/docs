# Create and run reports

## Create the report template

Use the Report Management dashboard component to set up the report template:

  1. Generate a new report template. Click on the _Template Editor_ tab, then the _Create_ button, and name the template.
  2. Select the report analytic that provides the basis of the report.
  3. Select the target engine. 
  4. Select the report action analytic(s). This determines how the report data are presented.

## Create the report instance

After saving the template, use the `Instance Editor` tab of the Report
Management dashboard component to create a report instance and set the
scheduling and action parameters.

  1. Select the _Create_ button at the top of the screen and name the report instance. Associate it with the report template created previously.
  2. Edit and save the report instance details. 
  3. Schedule the report: `once`, `daily`, `weekly`, `monthly`, or at a specified time.

  4. Set the permission for users and user groups.

  5. In the _Advanced Details_ tab set an override target engine – if you want the report instance to query a different process. Select additional report actions or set parameters for existing report actions. For example, the mailing list and file location are set here.

## Run the report

Use the _Run_ button (in the Report Management dashboard component’s
_Instances_ tab) to run a report manually. With the scheduling parameters set,
the report can either be run directly from the _Instances_ tab, or set to run
as scheduled, e.g. at end of day.

The _Run Info_ tab shows information about past reports. This can be searched
by report name and start and end times.

## Displaying report management in UTC

To have the run information of past reports displayed in UTC time instead of
server time a configuration parameter should be created called
DS_REPORT_UTC:DEFAULT

This should have an attribute called UTC of boolean type. Set this to true and
restart the environment to display run info in UTC time, i.e. **restart
Control and the report workflow**.
