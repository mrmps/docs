to be launched or run on an automated schedule, a task is used to do this. The
basic scheduling options can be seen in the figure below. (Click to expand.)

To create a new task pick _File > New > Task_. When prompted, assign the task
a unique name and include in any package if needed. There are four tabs in the
Process Task Editor.
