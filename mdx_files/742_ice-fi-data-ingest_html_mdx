# ICE Fixed Income Accelerator Data Ingestion

There are several pipelines in the KX Fixed Income Accelerator to ingest data,
they are outlined briefly below.

Commands to update the s3/blob storage location of the files which these
pipelines target for ingestion can be found in the [quickstart guide](ice-
fixed-income-quickstart.html#quick-start-guide).

## Reference Data Ingestion

Pipelines for ingest of COREREF and CROSSREF reference files. These pipelines
are:

  * icecorereference 
  * icecrossreference

These pipelines ingest the data to the `Instrument` table in Insights
Enterprise. Ingestion of COREREF and CROSSREF files, along with ratings and
sector information detailed below, is necessary to fully populate the Fixed
Income Overview and Drilldown Insights Views.

## Ratings Data Ingestion

A pipeline to ingest APEX GSM data (ratings and sector information):

This pipeline uses the ISIN number ingested from the CROSSREF ICE reference
file to join the APEX GSM data to the existing reference data in the
`Instrument` table. As such, the ISIN numbers should already be populated in
the `Instrument` table before the `iceratings` pipeline is run.

## Historic replay data ingest

A pipeline to ingest historic data using ICE REPLAY files to the `Quote` table
in Insights Enterprise:

  * icehistoricreplayfixedincome

This pipeline should be used if it is necessary to ingest replay (historic)
data.

## Realtime Data ingest

To ingest realtime data into the KX Fixed Income Accelerator, follow the steps
outlined in the [quickstart guide](ice-fixed-income-quickstart.html#quick-
start-guide).

## Generating bar data

A pipeline to generate bar data from the `Quote` table:

The historic elements of the Fixed Income Overview and Drilldown Insights
Views require bar data in order to be populated. Refer to the [Historic Fixed
Income Data](ice-fi-historic-data.html) documentation.
