# Preview

The `preview` API is a lightweight data retrieval API which is able to fetch
small samples of a table using minimal time and resources, for you to review
or to use in testing software compatibility with a schema.

## Parameters

name | required | type | description  
---|---|---|---  
`table` | yes | `symbol` | Name of table to retrieve data from.  
`startTS` | no | `timestamp` | Inclusive start time of the period of interest. This field is optional. By default the preview is from the full temporal range of the database. The timestamp must be midnight so the date range covers full days.  
`endTS` | no | `timestamp` | Exclusive end time of period of interest. This field is optional. By default the preview will be from the full temporal range of the database. The timestamp must be midnight so the date range covers full days.  
`limit` | no | `long` | Maximum number of rows to return. The default limit is 1000.  
  
## Result

The `preview` API returns up to `limit` rows from the specified table and time
range. It is guaranteed to search all available data for results. If fewer
than `limit` rows are returned, they contain all the available data. Beyond
this there are no guarantees as to which particular rows are returned, and the
choice is subject to arbitrary implementation details.
