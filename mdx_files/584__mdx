# State at time

![Screenshot](../img/monitoring/stateattimedashboard.png)

On the _Monitoring_ dashboard the _State at Time_ tab displays an overview of
the state of the system for any time in the past – useful for interrogating
the system state before or during a process or system failure.

Its league tables

can be filtered by _Date_ , _Lookback_ (in seconds), _Host Group_ , _Alias_
and _PID_. _Lookback_ averages data values over the lookback period. Specify
the filter values and click _Submit_ to update the display.

Sort table rows by any column by clicking on its heading.

## Process CPU memory league table

![Screenshot](../img/monitoring/processcpumemoryleaguetable.png)

This table displays details of the processes using the most CPU and memory.
(Processes using nominal levels are ignored.)

Information displayed:

column | content  
---|---  
Time | Time the snapshot was taken. The frequency of updates is controlled by the _Lookback_ seconds specified in the filters  
SignalHost | Name of the host group  
PID | Process ID  
Name | Type of process, e.g. q, Java  
UserName | User running the process  
CPU | Percentage of CPU being used by the process  
Memory | Amount of memory, in Mb, being used by the process  
lastCore | Last CPU core the process was recorded to have run on  
alias | Identifier for the connection: in many cases, a work station to the Tomcat, for which you will see a machine name  
  
## Network connections league table

This table shows all network connections on the monitored hosts. This includes
the source and remote address, ports, the length of their send and receive
queues, and alias information.

column | content  
---|---  
Time | Time the network connections snapshot was taken  
sym | Host name  
recvQ | Receive queue size  
sendQ | Send queue size  
localaddr | Local address  
spid | Process ID associated with the queues  
localport | Local port connection point  
remoteaddr | Remote address  
remoteport | Remote port connection point  
alias | A combination of fields to identify the connection to the process instance displayed: in many cases, a work station to the Tomcat, for which you will see a machine name  
state | State of the connection, usually `established`  
processAlias | Process connection name or an alias that it is known by  
  
## Server memory league table

This table displays server memory stats for all servers in the system – useful
for identifying the servers using the most memory.

The information displayed:

column | content  
---|---  
Time | Time memory server table was updated  
signalHost | Name of the host  
UsedPercent | Amount used  
memTotal | Total memory (Mb)  
actualFree | Actual free memory (Mb) including buffer cache  
actualUsed | Actual amount of memory used (Mb), including allocated cache  
swapTotal | Size of the swap memory partition (Mb), the virtual memory stored on disk  
swapUsed | Amount of swap memory used (Mb)  
  
## CPU core league table

Ths table displays the CPU cores used most actively for all servers defined
within the system, displaying individual statistics for all CPUs in each
server.

The information displayed:

column | content  
---|---  
Time | Time the CPU core league table was updated  
signalHost | Host name that the cpu data applies to  
cpu | CPU  
IdlePC | Percentage of CPU capacity idle  
TotUsedPC | Percentage of CPU capacity in use  
UsedUserPC | Percentage of CPU capacity in use by users  
UsedSysPC | Percentage of CPU capacity in use by the system  
UsedWaitPC | Percentage of CPU capacity in wait state, idle with at least one input or output operation in progress  
  
## File system league table

![Screenshot](../img/monitoring/filesystemleaguetable.png)

This table displays file-system usage statistics for all servers defined
within the system.

The information displayed:

column | content  
---|---  
Time | Time the file-system league table snapshot was taken  
signalHost | Host this item relates to  
devName | File system being analyzed  
usedPct | Percentage of the file system used  
availableGB | Space available on the filesystem (Gb)  
usedGB | Space used on the file system (Gb)  
totalGB | Space on the file system (Gb)  
diskReadMB | Read-only space on the file system (Mb)  
diskWriteMB | Read-write space on the file system (Mb)
