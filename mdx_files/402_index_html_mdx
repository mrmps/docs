# Configuration

A kdb Insights Database's configuration is composed of a schema, a stream, and
multiple data tiers for real-time and historical data. In kdb Insights
Enterprise, a database can be configured using the [kdb Insights user
interface](../../../enterprise/database/configuration/ui/database.html), or
using a configuration file called an [assembly
file](assembly/database.html#assembly).

At a minimum, an kdb Insights Database needs:

Once the database has been configured, the database can be
[deployed](../deploy/index.html).

Configuration methods

In kdb Insights and kdb Insights Enterprise, configuration for a database can
be submitted through an [assembly file](assembly/database.html). When using
kdb Insights Enterprise, databases can also be configured using the [Insights
user interface](../../../enterprise/database/configuration/ui/database.html).
