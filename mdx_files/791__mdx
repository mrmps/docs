# Accordion

A panel with expandable sections

The Accordion component is divided into sections. Each section can hold a
single component - including a nested accordion - or a workspace like [Layout
Panel](../layout/).

## Set up

  1. Define how many sections you need.

  2. Within each section, add a single component, [layout panel](../layout/), or [flex panel](../flexpanel/) for multiple components. 

## Basics

_Name_

    A name for the component provided by the user. 
_Direction_

    Switch between a Vertical and Horizontal accordion control. Can nest one Accordion component inside another.

_Scale on Resize_

    Resize a child component when the accordion panel is resized, or wait until after accordion resize to resize child components. 

## Sections

_Title_

    A name for the section 
_Title Align_

    Sets position of Title in section bar: `left`, `center` or `right`
_Expanded_

    

When checked, the Accordion will load with the section expanded.

Controlling the open and closing of accordion sections can be achieved by
assigning a boolean [View State Parameter](../viewstateparameters/) to the
_Expanded_ property. By setting the View State Parameter to True – on a click
of a [Data Form](../dataform/) Submit button for example – users can determine
when elements of the dashboard become visible.

_Flex_

    When enabled, the section will resize to accommodate its child component's dimensions where possible, for example resizing to accommodate a Dataform that can can take up different heights depending on the number of items and the width of the screen.
    Some components, such as charts, do not specify dimensions themselves but rather fill their parent. In these cases a Flex section's dimensions is defined in pixels by _Min Size_ and _Max Size_. The _Weight_ and _Resizable_ properties below do not apply to Flex sections.
_Weight_

    

This is a relative sizing measure to determine the viewable area for each
section inside the Accordion.

For example, two sections of _Weight_ `200` will each take up half of the
viewable area (200/(200+200)). A section with _Weight_ of `400` and another of
`200` will occupy 66% (400/(400+200)) of the viewable area.

Section behavior on resize

If Resizable is checked, the values of _Weight_ will change on interaction.

_Resizeable_

    

If checked, the user will be able to adjust the section size

_Hide Title_

    When checked, suppresses the section title

## Linking two sections

Multiple sections in a single accordion can share a behavior if they use the
same [View State Parameter](../viewstateparameters/) as their _Expanded_
setting:

## Linking two accordions

Two or more Accordions can be linked so an expansion or contraction in a
section of one will be reflected in another.

To do this, assign the same View State Parameter to the sections’ _Expanded_
settings.
