# Troubleshooting

If no data is visible in the processes that should be receiving them, try to
isolate the problem by considering the following;

  1. Are the schemas associated with the relevant processes?
  2. Is the messaging server `DS_MESSAGING_SERVER:DS` set in the parameters of the _TP_ , _RDB_ , and _RTEs_?
  3. Is the _TP_ receiving data?
     * If there are errors in the feed logic, data may not be created
     * Check the `publishChannel` of the feed
     * Check the `subscriptionChannel` of the _TP_
     * Check the TP logs on disk and see if they are increasing in size
  4. Are the subscribing processes not receiving data although _TP_ is publishing them?
     * Check if the `subscriptionChannel` is same as the _TP_ `publishChannel`
  5. Are the subscribers receiving data but not updating the table?
     * Check the `realTimeMsgFunct`
  6. If the _RDB_ is receiving data, but the _IHDB_ isn't
     * Check if the _LR_ and intraday log directory is configured correctly
  7. If the _HDB_ doesn't have data after EOD
     * Check if the _LR_ and hdb log directory is configured correctly

Below are useful tables to reference to ensure the correct processes are
publishing and subscribing to the correct channels.

  * Connect to the messaging server:

table name | return table  
---|---  
`.dm.source` | processes signed up with MS for publishing data  
`.dm.consumer` | processes signed up with MS for receiving data  
`.dm.qipc` | processes you are connected to  
`.dm.subscription` | matches between the publisher and subscriber  
  
  * Connect to publisher processes:

table name | return table  
---|---  
`.dm.filters` | the topics on the publisher  
`.dm.qipc` | processes you are connected to
