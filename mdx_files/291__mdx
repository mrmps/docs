## Plugins

### Startup message

The startup message can be changed by adding a directory to
`<install>/plugins/`.

In the directory, include a plugin manifest file named `plugin.json`:

    
    
    {
        "id"      : "startup-message",
        "version" : "1.0.0",
        "q"       : { "file": "startup.q" }
    }
    

And a file to run (`startup.q`) after loading Developer:

    
    
    .ax.sa.plugin.loadMessage: {[opts]
        -1 "Welcome to KX Developer";
        }
    

The options provided to the function include the webserver docroot and the
product banner:

    
    
    docroot| "/ax"
    banner | "[analyst] "
    

## Key bindings

Key bindings can be remapped by opening the Keyboard Reference dialog from the
Help menu. Any keyboard shortcuts recognized by the components open on the
current page will be shown. Those that can be modified will appear as text
fields. To change a hotkey, click a text field, and press the new key
combination.

To restore a single hotkey to its default value, click the "x" beside it. To
restore all hotkeys currently shown in the dialog, press "Restore Defaults".

Any changes will not apply to pages already open. These must be refreshed to
use the new keybindings.

A key binding can be cleared by pressing backspace (Windows or Linux) or
delete (Mac).
