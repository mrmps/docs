# BigQuery API

Google BigQuery is a fully-managed, serverless data warehouse that enables
scalable analysis over petabytes of data.

The KX BigQuery API allows users to easily interact with the REST API that
Google exposes for BigQuery, detailed
[here](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/rest).

This API aims to provide some key benefits to the use:

  * An easy-to-use kdb+ interface without needing to handcraft REST API calls
  * Automatic conversion of BigQuery [TableSchemas](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/tables#TableSchema) in kdb+ tables
  * Dynamic support for all resources and methods exposed in the BigQuery API
