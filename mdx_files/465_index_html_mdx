# kdb Insights Python API

The kdb Insights Python API provides the capability to interact with _kdb
Insights_ and _kdb Insights Enterprise_ from Python. This library allows you
to [publish](publish.html) and issue [queries](query.html) against each of
these products. Refer to the installation section below for information on how
you can install this library.

Once installed, the [quickstart guide](quickstart.html) provides you with
examples of querying _kdb Insights_ and _kdb Insights Enterprise_ using the
various functionality available to you.

KX Nexus

The KX Nexus repository will be sunsetted in the future. Nexus links on this
page are provided as a temporary alternative to the KX Downloads Portal for
existing users. The KX Downloads Portal is the preferred repository for all
use cases and KX Nexus links will be removed once the KX Nexus repository is
decommissioned.

## Installation

To install the kdb Insights Python API ensure you have a recent version of pip
installed:

    
    
    pip install --upgrade pip
    

Then to install the `kxi` library run the following command:

    
    
    pip --no-input install --extra-index-url=https://portal.dl.kx.com/assets/pypi/ kxi
    

The above command uses the KX Downloads Portal and new users must use that
command.

Existing users can use the following command to instead install from KX Nexus,
until Nexus is removed in the future:

    
    
    pip --no-input install --extra-index-url=https://nexus.dl.kx.com/repository/kxi-pypi-public/simple/ kxi
    

The `pykx` library isn't installed by default on installations of the `kxi`
library. To fully utilize the `kxi` library, use the following command to
install the `pykx` library from the _KX Downloads Portal_ :

    
    
    pip --no-input install --extra-index-url=https://portal.dl.kx.com/assets/pypi/ "kxi[all]"
    

Alternatively, for existing users, use this command to install the `pykx`
library from KX Nexus:

    
    
    pip --no-input install --extra-index-url=https://nexus.dl.kx.com/repository/kxi-pypi-public/simple/ kxi"[all]"
    

The addition of the `[all]` argument enables PyKX to be retrieved from
https://pypi.org/.
