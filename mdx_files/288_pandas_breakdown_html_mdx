# Pandas Like API for PyKX Tables

The aim of this page is to demonstrate PyKX functionality that aligns with the
approach and principles of the Pandas API for DataFrame interactions. Not all
operations supported by Pandas are covered, only the operations on PyKX tables
that follow Pandas API conventions. In particular, it focuses on areas where
PyKX/q has the potential to provide a performance advantage over the use of
Pandas. This advantage may be in the memory footprint of the operations and/or
in the execution time of the analytic.

A full breakdown of the the available functionality and examples of its use
can be found [here](Pandas_API.html).

## Covered sections of the Pandas API

Coverage in this instance refers here to functionality covered by the PyKX API
for Tables which has equivalent functionality to the methods and attributes
supported by the Pandas DataFrame API. This does not cover the functionality
supported by Pandas for interactions with Series objects or for
reading/writing CSV/JSON files etc.

If there's any functionality you would like to see added to this library,
please open an issue [here](https://github.com/KxSystems/pykx/issues) or open
a pull request [here](https://github.com/KxSystems/pykx/pulls).
