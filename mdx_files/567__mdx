# Filewatcher - KX Delta Platform

Original URL: https://code.kx.com/platform/stream/filewatcher_template/

# DS_FILEWATCHER

This process is used to poll/scan a configurable set of directories for target
files. Upon identification of the arrival of a target file an analytic is
called which can load the data from that file, transform/cleanse the data and
publish it onto KX Delta Platform.

On finding any file, a message Is published to identify that a file has
arrived and if the file matches the regular expression in configuration, it
will also try to process that file.

An Alert can be triggered for a missing file based on expected arrival time.
