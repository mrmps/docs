Any file in ending in `.md` can be rendered to a tab within Analyst. There are
two ways of rendering Markdown files:

  * from the sidebar, by right-clicking the Markdown files within a repository

  * from an open editor containing a `.md` file by right-clicking the editor

This has a few advantages:

**Synced changes with the corresponding editor**

When rendered from an editor, saving any changes in the editor will
immediately be available in the Markdown window.

**Executable, syntax-highlighted, code blocks**

Clicking the â–¶ button in a code block will execute the code contained.

Note the grid layout of the output table in the console. This display mode can
be chosen by right clicking on the console and selected _Show output as
grids_.

**Move code block content to Scratchpad for editing**

Clicking _Scratchpad_ in any code block will move the contained code to the
last active scratchpad to allow editing/experimenting.
