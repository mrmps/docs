# Application interface

When issuing a query using either the q or REST interface, a common interface
is used for sending the request and indicating status. Requests can include
custom fields using a [request header](header.html#request-header) to tune the
behavior of the query. On response, a [response header](header.html#repsonse-
header) is sent back with a [return code](codes.html#return-code) indicating
the overall status of the request, and an [application
code](codes.html#application-code) indicating any specific response statues.
