# Upgrade Dashboards - KX Dashboards

Optional `demo.q` backup

If you have created custom functions for use in
[Builder](../visualquerybuilder/#add-function) or have added .csv files as
part of the _html5evalcongroup_ connection referenced in `demo.q` \- rename
`demo.q` as `demo.bak`. You will need to copy your changes from the `demo.bak`
file back to the new `demo.q` file after installing the update.

New `.csv` files in the _sample/data_ directory do not need to be backed up as
part of the upgrade as only existing demo `.csv` files will be overwritten
