# Static file

_Read a static file, parse the data, perform a filter and a reduction on the
data, then write the average to a function`numberAvg` on another kdb+ process_

The same pipeline API is used for both static/batch and stream processing
within the Stream Processor.

Replacing the [`.qsp.read.fromFile`](../../../api/stream-
processor/q/readers.html#qspreadfromfile) with
[`.qsp.read.fromCallback`](../../../api/stream-
processor/q/readers.html#qspreadfromcallback) would result in the same logic
being applied to data sent to a stream callback.

## Pipeline spec

Run the pipeline to read and process the file. Both specs create a sample file
containing numbers to process.
