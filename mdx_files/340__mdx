_Data Source_

    A [data source](../datasources/) containing a time series (number, dates or timestamps), shared with the component being played back. 
_Selected Value_

    A [View State Parameter](../viewstateparameters/) for the time series.
_Selected Column_

    An Integer or temporal column from the _Data Source_ , used in playback sequence.
_Time Column_

    A temporal column from the _Data Source_ (can be the _Selected Column_).

_Max Overall Time_

    Upper limit in data points (of the _Time Column_ , e.g. seconds, nanaoseconds) for replay based on _Selected Value_ View State Parameter.
_Interval Time_

    Sampling interval of the _Selected Value_ View State Parameter: values above `1` will skip data points; e.g. a value of `2` will use every second data point of the _Selected Value_ View State Parameter.
_Speed_

    Define default speed for playback.
_Playing_

    Define for playback: `0` is static, `1` plays forward, `-1` plays backwards. Multiples, e.g. `4` will play at x4 speed. 
_Display Warning Message_
