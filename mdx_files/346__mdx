Original URL: https://code.kx.com/platform/monitoring/monitoring-configuration/

# Monitoring configuration

`Monitor_Config` dashboard allows the user to setup and config what _KX
Monitoring_ will monitor and alert on.

## Monitoring config

### Server groups

![Screenshot](../img/monitoring/addserver.png)

Associate servers in logical groups e.g. `Dev`, `UAT`, `Prod`. Within the main
_Monitoring_ dashboard,you can then filter by these specific groups. For
example, to filter State At Time by Host Group, see [Process CPU Memory League
Table](../state-at-time/#process-cpu-memory-league-table).

These groups will be available within the _Monitoring_ dashboard to display
data at a server level, or grouped across servers in a selected group.

To add a server to the group: click the plus button to insert a new row in the
table; enter the server name and server-group details; click the _Save_
button.

To remove a server: click on the server to be removed; click the _Delete_
button; click the _Save_ button.

### Sysmon

![Screenshot](../img/monitoring/sysmonconfiguration.png)

Use this tab to configure the Delta Daemon collection agent, SysMon. Each row
contains information about the data that the collection agent will publish to
each ops tickerplant (TP). The collection agent should be configured to
publish the collected data to 2 TPs for failover.

With the exception of this configuration parameter, all configuration updates
are pushed automatically in real time to all Delta Daemon SysMon collection
agents. Updates to this configuration will require a restart of the Daemon
SysMon collection agents.

parameter | use  
---|---  
cpuMessagePeriodCount | How often to send a message to the `dmxsysCPU` schema  
networkMessagePeriodCount | How often to send a message to the `dmxsysNIC` schema  
defaultTags | Tags to set on signal registrations. For example `DELTAMON`, `SYSMON`  
heartbeatMessagePeriodCount | How often to send a heartbeat message  
intervalPeriodMS | Minimum polling interval, specified in milliseconds; defaults to 1000  
tpConnName | Name of the tickerplant to connect to. e.g. `ts_tp_ops_a`  
procConfig | Name of the configuration to use to load the process (PID) filters. Defaults to `DM_SYSMON_CONFIG_PROC`  
defaultHierarchy | Hierarchy to set on signal registrations, e.g. `SYSMON`  
netConnectionMessagePeriodCount | How often to send a message to `dmxsysNetConn` schema  
systemMessagePeriodCount | How often to send a message to the `dmxsysServer` schema  
procMessagePeriodCount | How often to send a message to the `dmxsysFileSystem` schema  
reloadConfigPeriodCount | How often to reload the configuration, specified in milliseconds  
diskMessagePeriodCount | How often to send a message to the `dmxsysFileSystem` schema  
diskLocalOnly | Gathering file system data on only local disks  
monAgent | Monitoring agent to use for system monitoring. `OSHI` and `Sigar` available as options.  
  
#### Monitoring agent

Previously SIGAR has been used as the monitoring agent to gather system
information, however the SIGAR library has not been actively maintained since
2010. Because of this, SIGAR has been known to have issues with recent
Operating System and JAVA versions.

Sysmon now uses the OSHI library as the default monitoring agent, with the
configurable option to continue using SIGAR within the Sysmon configuration
parameter.

The OSHI system monitoring agent provides a near one-to-one match with what
SIGAR originally provided. Known gaps in OSHI: * `dmxsysNIC` \- Network
interface overruns and Frame statistics unavailable. * `dmxsysPID` \-
Identification of processor and some processor specific statistics
unavailable. * `dmxsysStatCPU` \- CPU cache unavailable

### HDB cleansing

![Screenshot](../img/monitoring/hdbcleansingconfiguration.png)

Use this tab to specify how long to keep data. This information is used by the
`ds_hdbcleanse_ops_a`/`b` process instances. Cleansing replaces ops data with
an aggregated version of the original. Duplicate entries may be removed and a
count based on the process instance and log message added to the summary
field.

parameter | use  
---|---  
dayOffset | The age in days at which the data is cleansed. For example, if set to 7, data partitions older than 7 days will be cleansed.  
analytic | Analytic to use when cleansing HDB, e.g. `dOpHDBCleanse_dxLog`.  
table | Name of the table to be cleansed, e.g `dxLog`. The first entry in the table column is the `DEFAULT` setting for all tables. Override these default settings by adding individual tables – click the plus button at the end of the table.  
  
### Process alias

![Screenshot](../img/monitoring/processalias.png)

Use this tab to define aliases for running process instances. These aliases
are used in other areas of _Monitoring_ , for example the _Alias_ filter field
on the [Process CPU Memory League table](../state-at-time/#process-cpu-memory-
league-table).

To add a new alias click the _Add row_ button at the bottom of the screen and
edit the row.

attribute | use  
---|---  
Alias | alias to apply to a process instance.  
weight | alias weighting. Aliases are used to configure alerts and color formatting. Because processes can have multiple aliases, it is necessary to assign weights to the aliases so that aliases with higher weights take priority.  
argsPattern | search strings to match against process-instance arguments. Enclose each search string with asterisks; separate them with semicolons e.g. `*foo*;*bar*`.  
  
### Process publishing

![Screenshot](../img/monitoring/processpublishing.png)

Use this tab to enable and disable log levels within the Monitor Ops
functionality. For example in State At Time, [Process CPU Memory League
table](../state-at-time/#process-cpu-memory-league-table). By default these
are disabled, in which case no information is logged.

Amendments made here are stored in the `DC_LOG_PUBLISH` configuration
parameter.

#### Toggle process publishing

In the _Process Publishing_ tab, set the log levels to be viewed in the
_Monitoring_ dashboard.

Use the `DEFAULT` process settings, which specify the publishing levels for
all processes, or add rows for individual processes and set the process
publishing requirements for each process.

Set publishing requirements to either `true` or `false`. The options are:

option | true means  
---|---  
Out | all `.log.out` messages are sent to the ops workflow and recorded in `dxLog`. This provides general logging information.  
Warn | all `.log.warn` messages are sent to the ops workflow and recorded in `dxLog`. This provides for warning message logging.  
Err | all `.log.err` messages are sent to the ops workflow and recorded in `dxLog`. This provides error message logging.  
Replay | all log replay messages get sent to the ops workflow.  
QueryLog | all queries made get sent to the ops workflow and recorded in `dxQueryLog`.  
AccessLog | all attempts to access processes get sent to the ops workflow and recorded in `dxAccessLog`.  
  
Once the publishing option for a process is set, click the _Save_ button.

#### Manage default process settings

The `DEFAULT` instance entry in the table defines behavior for any process not
specified in the table.

  1. Add a row with _instance_ set to `DEFAULT`, or edit the table row if it exists.
  2. Set your publishing requirements to either `true` or `false` for each of the publishing options.
  3. Click _Save_ to save your changes.

Default logging behavior

Increasing the logging on the default process can cause a large spike in data
collection, requiring additional disk space to store this data.

#### Remove a process from the publishing list

Click _Delete_ on a highlighted row to remove a selected process from the
table. Its behavior will then be defined by the `DEFAULT` settings.

### File size and growth

#### FileSizeConfig

![Screenshot](../img/monitoring/filemonitorconfiguration.png)

Through the _File Size / Growth Configuration_ tab of the Monitoring_Config
dashboard specify the minimum, maximum, and growth size of files and
directories to be monitored.

To add a new file to be monitored, edit the details described in the table,
then click _Save_.

parameter | controls  
---|---  
minGrowthSize | min amount file should increase during growth period (Kb)  
maxGrowthSize | max amount file should increase during growth period (Kb)  
directory | directory path to monitor files  
filePattern | (optional) search pattern to match file names  
minimumSize | min size allowed for file (Kb)  
host | hostname for file (may include wildcard *)  
maximumSize | max size allowed for file (Kb)  
growthPeriod | time period in which a file should grow between the `minGrowthSize` and `maxGrowthSize` limits  
startTime/endTime | daily time frame for monitoring  
active | boolean indicates whether file is to be monitored for growth  
alertLevel | level to apply when breaches are made WARN/ERROR  
monitorWeekends | boolean indicates whether file should be monitored during weekends  
  
#### LogScraper

![Screenshot](../img/monitoring/logscraperconfigurationhtml.png) _Log Scraper
configuration_

Log Scraper configuration dashboards. This allows the user to add and remove
log scraping from any file on a monitored server. [Log Scraping](../log-
scraping/) provides full details on how to setup complex scraping patterns.

### Server alerts

![Screenshot](../img/monitoring/serveralertsparameterconfiguration.png)
_Server-specific alert configuration is configured on the Server Alerts tab_

In this tab, set the following server-alert configuration parameters:

#### 1 min load

![Screenshot](../img/monitoring/server1minload.png)

This parameter controls monitoring of the one-minute load of a server. It is
used to compare against the observed one-minute load average stored within the
`dmxsysStateServer` table by the SysMon process. Each row of the parameter
represents a satellite server.

The attributes of this parameter:

attribute | description  
---|---  
breachLevel | Should be left blank: populated by the alert when carrying out checks on memory usage.  
breachThreshold | Should be left blank: populated by the alert when carrying out checks on memory usage.  
errorThreshold | The percentage level at which an error is triggered for the relevant attribute.  
sym | The name of the host to be monitored.  
active | Flag: if `false`, _Monitor_ ignores this parameter.  
logicalName | Should be left blank: populated by the alert when carrying out checks on memory usage.  
warningThreshold | The percentage level at which a warning is triggered for the relevant attribute.  
breachValue | Should be left blank: populated by the alert when carrying out checks on memory usage.  
  
#### Server CPU

![Screenshot](../img/monitoring/servercpu.png)

This parameter is used for monitoring that CPU usage is within a given
threshold. It is used to compare against the observed CPU usage stored in the
`dmxsysStateServer` table by the SysMon process. Each row of the parameter
represents a satellite server.

The attributes of this parameter:

attribute | description  
---|---  
breachLevel | Read-only: populated by the alert when carrying out checks on memory usage.  
breachThreshold | Read-only: populated by the alert when carrying out checks on memory usage.  
errorThreshold | This is an integer representation of the CPU usage. A value of 90 would represent 90% CPU usage. Once the CPU usage exceeds this value an error is triggered and an alert generated  
sym | The name of the host to be monitored.  
active | Flag: if `false`, _Monitor_ ignores this parameter.  
logicalName | Read-only: populated by the alert when carrying out checks on memory usage.  
warningThreshold | This is an integer representation of the CPU usage. A value of 80 would represent 80% CPU usage. Once the CPU usage exceeds this value a warning is triggered and an alert generated.  
breachValue | Read-only: populated by the alert when carrying out checks on memory usage.  
  
#### Server alert times

![Screenshot](../img/monitoring/serveralert.png)

Used to configure monitoring of the servers themselves. It ensures that
servers are running between specified times and the period of time they can be
inactive before alerts are generated. Each row of the parameter represents a
satellite server.

The attributes of this parameter:

attribute | description  
---|---  
period | The period of time the server is allowed to go without update.  
sym | The name of the host being monitored.  
endTime | The time at which monitoring should end.  
active | Flag: if `false`, _Monitor_ ignores this parameter.  
startTime | The time at which monitoring should begin.  
  
#### Server load

![Screenshot](../img/monitoring/serverload.png)

The Server Load (1-, 5-, and 15-minute) allows the alerting on the load levels
on a specific server (sym) value

attribute | description  
---|---  
MinLoad15 | Threshold for server 15-min load.  
sym | The host name.  
MinLoad1 | Threshold for server 1-min load.  
active | Flag: if `false`, _Monitor_ ignores this parameter.  
MinLoad5 | Threshold for server 5-min load.  
  
### Log message alerts

![Screenshot](../img/monitoring/logmessagealerts.png)

Use the Log Message Alerts tab to configure alerts based on the process log
messages. Each process has its own log file; however, for this configuration
to be of use, those processes must also populate the `dxLog` table within the
RDB ops process. This depends on the `DC_LOG_PUBLISH` configuration. Set this
in the _Process Publishing_ tab of the `Monitoring_Config` dashboard.

The parameter can be configured to generate alerts on all warning or error
messages generated by _KX Delta Platform_ processes. It can also be configured
to generate alerts on specific error messages. This is done by matching a
regex to the summary field of the log message.

The attributes of this parameter:

attribute | description  
---|---  
level | The level of message to trigger an alert. If set to `Warn` an alert would be created on a warning message.  
sym | The name of the process instance being monitored. If blank it will trigger on all process instances.  
active | Flag: if `false`, _Monitor_ ignores this parameter.  
summarySearch | A search string used to search the summary field of a log message. For example if `upd` is entered here it would search for messages with `upd` in the summary description  
  
### Process instance alerts

Three parameters are defined:

  * Process Instance Alert
  * PID Resident Memory
  * Process CPU Alert

#### Process instance alert

![Screenshot](../img/monitoring/processdownalerts.png)

Configures monitoring of the individual _KX Delta Platform_ processes running
on any or all satellite servers. It ensures that particular process instances
are active within a designated time frame. Each row of the parameter
represents an individual process.

The attributes of this parameter:

attribute | description  
---|---  
period | The period of time the instance is allowed to go without update. If the process instance fails to update within the period defined here an alert will be generated.  
sym | The name of the host being monitored.  
endtime | The time at which monitoring should end. If a process instance is not running within the specified time frame an alert is generated.  
active | Flag: if `false`, _Monitor_ ignores this parameter.  
instanceSearch | The pattern used to match against running process instances. This can be a regex or the name of the process instance that is to be monitored. For example searching for an instance name via search pattern `tp` would be all TP process instances  
starttime | The time at which monitoring should begin.  
  
#### PID resident memory

![Screenshot](../img/monitoring/pidresidentmemory.png)

The attributes of this parameter::

attribute | description  
---|---  
errorThreshold | The value in Mb of RAM consumed. When memory usage exceeds this value an error is generated.  
sym | The process name (matches field against args of running instances).  
minWarningThreshold | The value in Mb for minimum resident memory. A warning will be generated when this threshold is breached.  
host | The host server. This is optional.  
active | Flag: if `false`, _Monitor_ ignores this parameter.  
minErrorThreshold | The value in Mb for minimum resident memory. An error will be generated when this threshold is breached.  
warningThreshold | The value in Mb of RAM consumed. When memory usage exceeds this value a warning is generated.  
  
#### Process CPU alert

![Screenshot](../img/monitoring/processcpualert.png)

Used for monitoring CPU usage by process. It is compared against the observed
CPU usage by each running process stored within the `dmxsysStatePID` table by
the SysMon process. Each row of the parameter represents a process or a
process instance alias to be monitored.

The attributes of this parameter:

attribute | description  
---|---  
errorThreshold | The percentage value of CPU consumed. When CPU usage exceeds this value an error is generated.  
sym | The process name (matches field against args of running instances).  
minWarningThreshold | The value in Mb for minimum CPU usage. A warning will be generated when this threshold is breached.  
host | The host server. This is optional.  
active | Flag: if `false`, _Monitor_ ignores this parameter.  
minErrorThreshold | The value in Mb for minimum CPU usage. An error will be generated when this threshold is breached.  
warningThreshold | The percentage value of CPU consumed. When CPU usage exceeds this value a warning is generated.  
  
### File system alerts

![Screenshot](../img/monitoring/filesystemusage.png)

The File System Usage Alert is used to monitor the disk-space usage. It is
compared against the observed disk space usage stored within the
`dmxsysStateFileSystem` table by the SysMon process. Each row within the
configuration parameter represents a network drive to be monitored.

The attributes of this parameter:

attribute | description  
---|---  
sym | The drive being monitored.  
host | The host server. This is optional.  
strictMatch | Flag: if `true`, exact match of drive to `sym` as configured. `false` will append wild cards to `sym`.  
warningThreshold | The percentage of disk space used. When disk space usage exceeds this value a warning is generated.  
errorThreshold | The percentage of disk space used. When disk space usage value exceeds this value an error is generated.  
active | Flag: if `false`, _Monitor_ ignores this parameter.  
  
### Notifications

Deprecation

Modern browsers no longer support Flash applications. As of KX Delta Platform
v4.6.0 alerts should be configured using ControlUI.

![Screenshot](../img/monitoring/notificationsettings.png)

Use ths tab to set up email notification to be sent when alerts are triggered.
You can also associate the notification with alert instances and specify their
frequency and recipients.

_Notification_

    Select a notification from the drop-down list to populate the notification details. Or click _New_ to add a new notification. When you create a new notification you specify a name for the notification and select the alert instance that it is associated with.
    ![Screenshot](../img/monitoring/newnotification.png)
_Alert Instance Name_

    The alert instance that the notification is associated with. 
_Update Type_

    

Indicates when the notification will be sent:

  * `On True`: Send notification on alert `triggered=true`
  * `On False`: Send notification on alert `triggered=false`
  * `On First True`: Send notification when the alert first sets `triggered=true`
  * `On First False`: Send notification when the alert first sets `triggered=false`
  * `On Change`: Send notification when the alert’s `triggered` value is not equal to its previous value
  * `On All`: Send notification regardless of the alert’s `triggered` state

_Time Since Last_

    Delay time from when a notification is sent until the next notification is sent. 
_Email Template_

    Template for the email that will be sent when the notification is triggered. The template can be edited by clicking _Edit_ or you can create a new template by clicking _New_.
    ![Screenshot](../img/monitoring/edittemplate.png)
_Recipients_

    This is the list of email addresses that will receive the notification. Click _Add_ to add a new recipient, you will need to specify a name and email address. Click on a recipient in the list and click _Edit_ to change the details.

### Notification suspension

![Screenshot](../img/monitoring/notificationsuspension.png)

Use this tab to set periods when email notifications are temporarily
suspended. You can also suspend notifications on weekends.

control | effect  
---|---  
Notification | Name of the notification to which the suspension applies.  
Delay | Start and end date and time for the suspension.  
Suspend at Weekends | Check to suspend emails on weekends (Saturday and Sunday).  
  
### Alert logs

Deprecation

Modern browsers no longer support Flash applications. As of KX Delta Platform
v4.6.0 alerts should be configured using ControlUI.

![Screenshot](../img/monitoring/alertlogs.png)

Use this tab to investigate the events that triggered an alert. You can view
logs of both notifications and alerts.

control | effect  
---|---  
Notifications | Check to select notifications. Use the dropdown list to select a specific notification.  
Alert | Check to select alerts. User the dropdown list to select a specific alert.  
Range | A date and time range to filter the results.  
  
## Mail server

To enable email alerts, it will be necessary to setup the the email server.

Use the _KX Control_ UI to set the following configuration parameters to the
correct email server:

  * `DS_LAUNCH_COMMANDLINE_PARAMS:ds_jemail`
  * `DS_JEMAIL_SERVER:exchangeAnonymous`
  * `DS_JEMAIL_SERVER:exchangeAuthenticated`

Which override of `DS_JEMAIL_SERVER` to use depends on whether the underlying
email service requires authentication to send emails.

![Screenshot](../img/monitoring/dslaunchcommandlineparamsdsjemail.png)

![Screenshot](../img/monitoring/dsjemailserverexchangeanonymous.png)

![Screenshot](../img/monitoring/dsjemailserverexchangeauthenticated.png)

Restart the `ds_jemail_a.1` process (via the _KX Control_ UI) to pick up the
changes.

## Advanced alert configuration

Advanced users can use the [Alert Management dashboard](../alert-management/)
to

  * define alert criteria and alert instances
  * define actions to be taken when alerts are triggered
  * suspend emails generated by certain alerts
  * inspect logs of alert activity
