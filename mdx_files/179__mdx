# Prepare deploy

## Prepare Linux deploy

Before you can deploy _KX Delta Platform_ , you will need to copy the
following files onto the Server which will host the application:

  * KX Delta Platform bundle(s)
    * Linux: GA + Patch bundles
    * Windows: Base + Patch bundles
  * License files

When the files have been copied to the server, the bundles will need to be
unpacked.

On Linux the bundles should be untarred in order, the GA bundle first, then
the Patch bundles.

    
    
    $ tar -xvzf PlatformKx-4.6.0-Linux-GA.tgz
    $ tar -xvzf PlatformKx-4.6.0-Linux-P1.tgz
    $ ls PlatformKx-4.6.0-Linux/
    

**Note** : the GA and Patch bundles will extract into the same directory,
merging the packages together.

Deploy Upgrade

When upgrading to 4.6.0 _KX Delta Platform_ , any existing deploys must also
be updated to the new Inclusive Terminology See [4.6.0 Upgrade
Process](../upgrade_process/#460-upgrade-process) for more details.

## Prepare Windows deploy

On Windows, the base Bundle should be unpacked into a directory which will
host the deployment. (**Note** : the installation path must not contain any
spaces).

**Note** : Ensure 7-zip is installed on your Windows server, see [Windows
Prerequisites](../win_prerequisites/#7-zip) for details.

To unpack click on the zip file select 7-Zip and then Extract Here.

## Copy licenses

The license files should be copied to a location which will be accessible by
the application. If you are installing the application on a Linux server or
running the deploy on a Windows server, you will be prompt to enter a
directory which contains the license files, which during deployment will be
copied into the `${DELTABIN_HOME}/config` directory.
