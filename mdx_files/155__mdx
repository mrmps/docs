# Installation scripts

## install.sh

The `install.sh` script is a user friendly wrapper around the
`installKxPlatform.sh` script for Bundle deployments. Recommended for new
users getting started.

### install.sh usage

    
    
    OPTIONS:
       -e      Use elastic KX license (kc.lic)
       -i      Load instance csv file
       -p      Load custom install config file
       -r      Reinstall failed deploy
       -s      Skip post deploy startup
       -h      Skip host check
       -n      Skip env check
       -?      Show this message
    

### install.sh deploy modes

When running the `install.sh` script in interactive mode, you will be prompt
to choose the deployment type.

    
    
    +-----------------------------------------------------------+
     [1] Single
     [2] Control
     [3] Web Server
     [4] Daemon
     [5] Control + Web Server
    +-----------------------------------------------------------+
     Select Node Type [1-5]: 
    

  1. **Single** : A single server installation, all processes will be run on the same host.
  2. **Control** : A Control only installation, will only install Control + kdb+ packages - excluding any front-end packages such as Tomcat/Appserver etc. Option to be used for when the kdb-node and the web-node will be installed on different servers.
  3. **Web Server** : A Web server only install, will only web packages such as Tomcat/Appserver/Dashboard etc. You will be required to point the deployment to an existing backend (Control node). See [Web Server Deploy](../lin_multi_node_deploy/#web-server-deploy) for more details.
  4. **Daemon** : Daemon only install, you will be required to point the deployment to an existing Control node.
  5. **Control + Web Server** : Cluster install, will install all components on the same server. Configure Leader/Follower control nodes. See [KX Delta Platform Cluster (A/B)](../lin_multi_node_deploy/#kx-platform-cluster-ab) for more details.

## installKxPlatform.sh

`installKxPlatform.sh` is the core installation script. The script can
executed manually, where the user can respond to a series of prompts to
configure a deployment. The script can also be executed in [non-interactive
mode](../non_interactive_install/) by providing an [Install config
file](../install_config/).

Install script renamed

As of version 4.6.0 of the _KX Delta Platform_ , the core install script has
been renamed from `installDeltaXML.sh` -> `installKxPlatform.sh`.

`installDeltaXML.sh` will continue to be used for KX Delta Platform
deployments pre 4.6.0 release.
