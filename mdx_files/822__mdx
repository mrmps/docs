# DC_ARCHIVE

Process to delete, zip or move old files.

## Parameters

The below table details the _DC_ARCHIVE_ template parameters.

name | type | default value | description  
---|---|---|---  
findFunct | Analytic | dxFileMatch | Analytic used to find files in a directory  
fileConfig | Config | DC_ARCHIVE_FILES | Files to archive  
  
## fileConfig

For each row in the fileConfig config parameter:

  * If numDaysOlderThan is -1 the row is ignored.
  * The findFunct analytic is run, the analytic should take 1 parameter which is the row passed in as a dictionary. e.g. dxFileMatch uses the system find command to find files or folders older than numDaysOlderThan in the directory like fileRegex but not like ignoreFileRegex. 
  * For each file or folder returned by findFunct the analytic in the row is run e.g. dxFileGzip or dxFileDelete. This analytic should also take 1 parameter which is the row passed in as a dictionary + the file/folder added as a dictionary key.
  * dxFileDelete will run rm â€“fr file.
  * dxFileGzip will run tar or gzip to create an archive file, and move it to destinationDirectory if destinationDirectory is not null.
