# What is kdb Insights Enterprise?

Reliable data capture and persistence is the bedrock of our business and our
greatest strength. Use kdb Insights Enterprise to capture and analyze your
high-volume, high-velocity, machine-generated, time-series data. Enterprise is
developed for use on any of the three major cloud providers: AWS (Amazon Web
Services), Microsoft Azure, or GCP (Google Cloud Platform) and has our super
fast columnar, time-series database, kdb+, at its heart.

Here are the key features:

**Data discovery and exploration**

  * Use kdb Insights Enterprise to take data from multiple sources (historical and real-time), process, and use the generated insights to inform decision-making processes in your business.

  * Interact with kdb Insights Enterprise through our user interface or command line interface.

  * We provide integrated tools to import, transform, and query data (using q, Python or SQL).

  * Create graphs and charts to spot patterns and trends, and to present your results.

**Scalability**

Due to its deployment in the cloud, kdb Insights Enterprise is almost
infinitely scalable. Scalability is dynamic, meaning that you can increase or
decrease database capacity according to your requirements.

**Familiar query and scripting languages**

Explore your data using familiar languages; q, Python, SQL.

**Access**

Access to kdb Insights Enterprise is restricted by robust authentication (user
identity checking) and authorization (permission to use system features is
defined in user accounts).

**Available and fault tolerant data**

  * kdb Insights Enterprise retains multiple copies of data, ensuring that no data point is duplicated or lost.

  * Multiple process redundancy for both streaming analytics and query processing, allowing process and node failure.

  * Deployed across multiple availability zones, allowing a single AZ failure.

**Diagnostics**

We provide a self-help diagnostics facility in the user interface, where you
can view logs of both historical and recent events.

**Support**

We provide support for kdb Insights Enterprise through one of the following
plans:

  * Customer managed plan, where you manage your own Enterprise deployment and we supply upgrades and platform support when you need it

  * KX managed plan, where we can request access to the relevant resources to manage the application on your behalf
