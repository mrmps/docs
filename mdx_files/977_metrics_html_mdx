# Monitoring overview

_kdb Insights Enterprise_ produces [metrics](metrics-reference.html) and
includes pre-packaged [alerts](alerts-reference.html) in order for you to
monitor the state of the application.

_kdb Insights Enterprise_ also provides pre-packaged Grafana
[dashboards](dashboards-reference.html) that provide visualizations to assist
with monitoring _kdb Insights Enterprise_.

They are all designed to work with the _Prometheus_ stack but do not ship with
it. You must deploy the _Prometheus_ stack and enable the application to
integrate with it.

This page describes how to install Prometheus. To enable metrics, alerts and
dashboards at installation time, use the details provided
[here](../configuration/observability.html#configure-logging).

[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/)

## Prometheus

The most common method of deploying _Prometheus_ is the [Prometheus
operator](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator).

This can be deployed alongside Grafana for visualizations, and Kubernetes node
metrics exporters to gather cluster-wide metrics. One example of this is the
[kube-prometheus-stack](https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-
charts/tree/main/charts/kube-prometheus-stack) _Helm_ chart. This is what we
will install.

### Deploying Prometheus

The _kube-prometheus-stack_ is usually deployed within its own namespace using
_Helm_. Full installation details are provided
[here](https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-
charts/blob/main/charts/kube-prometheus-stack/README.md).

  1. Create a namespace
    
        kubectl create ns monitoring
    

  2. Install using _Helm_
    
        export RELEASE_NAME=kx-prom
    helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
    helm repo update
    helm install $RELEASE_NAME prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack -n monitoring
    

Monitoring release name

Take note of your chosen `$RELEASE_NAME` as this is required when configuring
_kdb Insights Enterprise_. In the example above, this is `kx-prom`.
