# 4.2.0 - KX Delta Platform

Original URL: https://code.kx.com/platform/stream/release_420/

# Changes in 4.2.0

## Messaging

Previously multi-publishing of tables into a tickerplant would always result
in the tables being split and published downstream separately. When batching
is disabled, these messages will now be published to consumers without being
split.

## Timezone support

The timezone and daylight savings data bundled with _KX Delta Platform_ has
been updated to the latest release.
