# Control UI API permissions

An administrator can make use of the full Control Web UI. If there are users
who are not administrators but need to interact with the UI there are several
permission groups that can be applied.

The API is granular around entity types. A user can be given permission to
some or all of the API groups to allow them to carry out different roles.

Many permissions may require access to the entity itself, for example task
permission will be based entirely on whether the user has permission to the
parent process instance.

Permission to create an entity will be based on whether a user has **update**
permission on the relevant API group. For example, to create an analytic the
user must have update permission on the UxAnalytics API group.

If a user has permission for a workflow they will see all tasks in that
workflow when it is opened, regardless of process instance permission level.

The basic Control UI functionality, including being able to view the
navigation tree and process status view, is governed by permission to the
`UxControl` API group.

The permissions can be assigned to a user or a user group in the _Entity
Permissions_ tab.
