# Managing groups

Groups are collections of [users](managing-users.html). In _kdb Insights
Enterprise_ they are associated with a [data
entitlement](../entitlements/index.html). Users who become members of a group
inherit the attributes, data entitlements and role mappings of that group.

## Creating groups

  1. Log into the administration console.
  2. Choose the target realm (`$REALM_NAME`) from the top-left realm drop-down.
  3. Click **Groups** in the menu.
  4. Click **Create group**.
  5. Enter the details for the new group.
  6. Click **Create**.

Warning

Ensure you select the correct realm (`$REALM_NAME`) as the UI defaults to the
`Master` realm on login.

## Assigning users

Assign users to a group through the **Members** tab for that group.

  1. Log into the administration console.
  2. Click **Users** in the menu.
  3. Click the user that you want to add to the group.
  4. Click **Join Group**.
  5. Select the group you want the user to join.
  6. Click **Join**.

## Assigning service accounts

Assign groups to a service account through the **Service accounts roles** tab
for that user.

  1. Log into the administration console.
  2. Click **Clients** in the menu.
  3. Click the service account that you want to add to a group.
  4. Click on the **Service accounts roles** tab
  5. Click the link just below the tab that states: **To manage detail and group mappings, click on the`service-account-<clientname>`**.
