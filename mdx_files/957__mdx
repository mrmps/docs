# Python integration

Python integration requires [embedPy](https://code.kx.com/q/ml/embedpy/)

KX Developer has usability integrations with Python through the use of
embedPy. If embedPy is installed in the kdb+ process Developer is running in,
users can enable Python integration from the _File > User Settings_ menu in
Developer.

Once Python integration is enabled, and embedPy is installed and loaded (using
`\l p.q`), the following integrations will be available.

## Interactive editor

Any open `.py` or `.p` files in Developer are interactive in a similar way to
regular _q_ editors. At any point, Python text can be selected and run by
using the editor context-menu or hotkey.

## Move data between kdb+ and Python

Moving data between the q and Python execution environments can be done
directly through the embedPy API, or through the Developer UI as follows:

In the _Process View_ tab of the Developer sidebar, any selected data can be
sent to the Python environment through the sidebar context-menu as seen below.

### Editors

Once the Python integrations are enabled, expressions can be assigned to
either execution environment through the use of the editor context-menus.

If in a q editor, select an expression or variable and select `Set Variable in
Python`.

If in a Python editor, the same can be done to move data to q as seen in the
interactive editor.

## Python support FAQ

See the [embedPy FAQ](https://code.kx.com/q/ml/embedpy/faq) for information
relating to Python support, particularly around data type compatibility
between Python and q.
