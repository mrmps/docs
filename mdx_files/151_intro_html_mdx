# OpenAPI

[OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) is an open standard that aims to
standardise how REST API's are defined.

We have developed tooling to enable kdb+ users to integrate more natively with
OpenAPI.

Specifically we have created a [library](q-client-generation.html) for
creating kdb+ clients from an OpenAPI specification.

## kdb Insights

kdb Insights microservices provide OpenAPI specifications that fully document
their APIs. These specifications are available under each Microservice OpenAPI
section.

By using code generation tools like [Swagger
Codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen), this means that kdb
Insights users can interact with kdb Insights microservices from any supported
language!
