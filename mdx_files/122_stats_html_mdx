# Statistics

_Compute different statistics using your data_

Statistics operators allow for quick computation of summary statistics and
different types of averages.

See APIs for more details

A q interface can be used to build pipelines programatically. See [the q
API](../../../../api/stream-processor/q/stats.html) for API details.

A Python interface is included along side the q interface and can be used if
PyKX is enabled. See [the Python API](../../../../api/stream-
processor/python/stats.html) for API details.

The pipeline builder uses a drag-and-drop interface to link together
operations within a pipeline. For details on how to wire together a
transformation, see the [building a pipeline guide](../index.html#building-a-
pipeline).
