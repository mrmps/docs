# KX Delta Platform deployment

_KX Delta Platform_ is delivered as a tarball bundle (Linux) or a zip file
(Windows) which contains installation scripts and component packages.

The _KX Delta Platform_ is deployed using a proprietary installation script on
Linux. In interactive mode, the script will prompt the user for information
about the deployment architecture before unpacking the relevant packages and
installing them into a chosen location on the host machine.

On Windows the _KX Delta Platform_ is delivered as a pre-deployed bundle which
can be unpacked and configured in place on the deployment host.

The _KX Delta Platform_ deployment process includes well known upgrade and
rollback paths which are detailed in this guide.
