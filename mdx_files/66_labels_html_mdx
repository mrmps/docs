# qp.labels file

_An optional file which can be incorporated into`qp build` to allow users to
append metadata to the docker container created._

## Requirements

  * place `qp.labels` file in the applications top level directory. Once `qp build` is called, it will be picked up and placed in the `qpbuild` directory.

## qp.labels format

General format is displayed below.

    
    
    LABEL label1="hello world!"
    LABEL label.kx.com="foo"
    ...
    

### Actions by qp

Once `qp.labels` is found and picked up during `qp build`, qp will then merge
the contents of the file with the `Dockerfile.app`. You will then be able to
view the metadata added to the container by calling the command below.

    
    
    docker inspect --format='' $INSTANCE_ID
