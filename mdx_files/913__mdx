[Exporter](exporter/) | Export datasets into other systems  
[Visual Inspector](inspector/) | Visualize massive datasets in real-time or near-real-time  
[Interactive editor](editor/) | Write applications using the q programming language  
[Debugger](quick-debugger/) | Debugger dramatically increases productivity  
Code Differ | Compare multiple versions of the functions or modules  
[Transformer](transformer/) | Groom, transform, filter and query datasets  
[Spreadsheet](spreadsheet/) | Perform analysis using simplified SQL query and scripting  
  
## Libraries

Contained within the KX Analyst package is a set of highly useful [q developer
libraries and scripts](libraries/) for use outside of the KX Analyst UI and
for automated build systems. The libraries contained provide support for:

  * Code coverage
  * Data visualization
  * Documentation generation from source annotations
  * Property-based testing
  * Q static linting and syntax checker
  * Regular expressions
