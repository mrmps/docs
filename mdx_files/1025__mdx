# Introduction

Dashboard components are defined as
[AMD](https://requirejs.org/docs/whyamd.html#amd) modules that return a
constructor function. This function is invoked with the initialization
parameters including a [DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-
US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model) element.

Download [Dashboards Direct](https://code.kx.com/dashboards/gettingstarted/)
for free to use as an SDK to develop components. Once complete, see
[Deployment](apideploy.md) for instructions on adding a component to your
Dashboards installation.

## Hello World

### 1\. Five lines of Javascript

Create a `HelloWorld` folder in **www/modules/** including a `main.js` file
with the code below.

    
    
    define(function () {
        return function (options) {
            options.el.textContent = "Hello World";
        }
    });
    

### 2\. Add component definition

Add a component definition to `components.json` inside the **www** folder.

    
    
     {
        "id": 10001,
        "componentName": "Hello",
        "componentDescription": "Simple component",
        "size": [400,600],
        "appKey": "HelloWorld/main",
        "listViewThumb": "<i class=\"fa fa-fw fa-smile-o\" />"
      },
    

### 3\. Refresh and drag

Refresh Dashboards in `Design` mode and drag your new component to the canvas.
