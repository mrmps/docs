## Upgrading kdb Insights Enterprise on Azure

Insights Managed Service (IMS) team will reach out to you to arrange a
maintenance window for upgrades. IMS will take care of upgrading the kdb
Insights Enterprise, the third party dependencies and the kubernetes version
of your AKS cluster.

If you have any questions please raise a
[ticket](https://kxsupport.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/15).

#### Upgrading AKS cluster

Rook-Ceph

If you have deployed rook-ceph, please do not use the Azure AKS rolling
upgrade feature. There are known issues with this. Please reach out to [KX
Support team](support.html) for assistance.

## Log data export

In cases where log data analysis is necessary, KX will require access to logs
stored in the Log Analytics Workspace deployed with the kdb Insights
Enterprise instance. In order to facilitate this, Data Export should be
enabled and a rule should be created by following the steps in [this
guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/logs-data-
export?tabs=portal#enable-data-export). When creating this rule, the resource
ID of the destination storage account will be provided to you as part of the
support ticket.
