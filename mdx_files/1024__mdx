# Splash-screen configuration

The default splash screen is displayed when the user navigates to the root
address `<host><port>` and looks, for example, like the following:

![Screenshot](../img/splashscreen.png)

The splash screen is defined by the file `index.html` in the folder
`â€¦/webapps/ROOT`.

The default splash screen can be changed to point to a different web page as
follows:

Now when the user navigates to `img/splashscreen.png` she will see the page
defined by `newSplash.html`.

If the `APPSERVER_SPLASHPAGE` environment variable is missing or incorrectly
defined, the default `index.html` page will be shown.
