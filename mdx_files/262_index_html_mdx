# Ingest and Transform Overview

Data ingestion brings external data into kdb Insights Enterprise. Data
ingestion can come in two forms, streaming data or batch data. Both cases of
data ingestion use the same building blocks as batch ingestion is just a
bounded case of streaming ingestion. Data ingestion and transformation is
powered by the [kdb Insights Stream Processor](../../microservices/stream-

The [import wizard](wizard.html) lets you connect external data sources with a
kdb Insights database.

sinks, transform data and analyze data in a drag and drop UI.
