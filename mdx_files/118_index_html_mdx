# Advanced database configuration

This section details additional configuration used for specialized use cases.
Under advanced configuration, you will find details about how to scale pods
under different circumstances.

## Scaling up queries

For large query loads, consider increasing the number of Data Access Processes
(DAPs) available to service queries. As the number of DAPs increases, the
number of concurrent connections to your Resource Coordinator (RC) increases.
RCs should be increased when the number of desired concurrent queries
increases. The [query scaling](query-scaling.html) guide outlines how to add
more DAPs and RCs to your configuration to increase the number of concurrent
queries.
