# Quickstart guide to creating Views

_This section provides a high-level guide to building[kdb Insights
Enterprise](index.html) Views._

The steps to building Views are listed below.

## Create database and pipeline

Before you can build your Views you must create and deploy a database to store
data and a pipeline to import data into the database. You can then add this
data to components on your view.

## Create a View

You can create a view by clicking on **Visualize** on the **Overview** page as
shown below.

## Add a component to your View

To add a component to the your View, click and drag a component from the list
of icons on the left of the workspace, into the centre as shown in the
following animation. The first component, Data Grid, is a good one to start
with.

## Configure the data source for the component

The data source defines where the data to be displayed comes from.

  1. Open the **Data** editor by clicking **Click to populate Data Source** inside the selected component.

## Format the components data

You can format the data inside the component; adding colors, highlight rules,
actions and/or filters.

## Add more components

You can continue to build the view by adding more components and data queries.

## Preview a View

Once you have designed your view, you can interact with it in the preview
panel.

Click **Preview** at the top of the workspace. Preview Mode enables you to
test the dashboard with the end-user level of interactivity.

## Save and share

Once your view is configured you can save it and share the URL link with
friends and colleagues. Click on the triple dot menu beside a View and click
**Share**.
