# Reports & the deltacomponent user

The `deltacomponent` user is used to execute reports within _KX Delta
Platform_. If the `deltacomponent` user in _KX Control_ is configured to be a
non-Administrator user then any solution reports may fail permission checks if
`deltacomponent` is not granted the appropriate permissions. For more
information on configuring `deltacomponent` to be a non-Administrator user and
to grant `deltacomponent` the correct permission to execute solution reports,
please review the relevant _KX Delta Platform_ documentation
