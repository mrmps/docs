Log file | Location | Description  
---|---|---  
install.log | `<bundle directory>` | Output of `install.sh` execution, basic information  
installKxPlatform.*.log | `<bundle directory>/scripts` | Detailed installation log  
DeltaControl.log | `<install directory>/delta-data/DeltaControlData/logdir` | Delta Control log  
*.log | `<install directory>/delta-data/DeltaControlData/logdir` | A log file will be created for each process instance or task executed  
e.g. `ds_rdb_ops_a.1.20200319T092835083.out.log`  
catalina.out | `<install directory>/delta-bin/software/Tomcat_*/latest/logs` | Tomcat application log file, redirected console output

### Package not being picked up by installer

The installation scripts contain a set of known packages to install (e.g. core
KX Delta Platform packages), if you have created a custom package, you will be
required to configure your `install.config` file to tell the installer how to
handle your package. See [Package List Options](../install_config/#install-
package-lists) for more details

### Failed to install package

The install configuration profile of each package can define a list of
packages which the package is dependant on to function. This installation
script will check that these packages are installed, if this check fails the
install script will exit with a failure.

    
    
    grep DEP install_config/profiles/DeltaStream.install.config
    DEP|DeltaControl
    

Above we can see that in order to install the DeltaStream package, the
DeltaControl package is required to be installed.

If the configuration profile does not contain the correct dependencies, and
the installer will therefore continue to try and install the packages, it is
possible to have a failure during the import of the packages to Control.

`auto import failed to start see DeltaControl.log for more info`

This will happen if there are entities that have dependencies on other
entities which are not available yet. To solve this issue:

  * Add DEP to install config profile to catch possible issues earlier in the installation process.
  * If you are using [Package List Options](../install_config_options/#install-package-list-options) ensure the package order is correct.

### Port changing during installation

The installation script has in-built logic to prevent an installation trying
to use a port which is already in use on the server. Due to this, it is
possible that the install script will not use the port specified during the
installation or in the install.config file, but the next available free port.

    
    
    [TOMCAT_PORT] Port [8080] in use
    Using port [8082]
    

If this is not the expected behavior, you should ensure that there is nothing
running on port `8080` before performing the installation.
