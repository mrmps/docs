# PostgreSQL Ingestion Example

_Query PostgreSQL for data_

[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) is an open-source relational
database system. This example demonstrates how to setup a simple PostgreSQL
database and query it from the kdb Insights Stream Processor.

This example is split into a [setup](setup.html) and [querying](query.html).
If you already have a running PostgreSQL database, consider jumping to the
running section.
