## Known Issues

Expand to see the list of known issues here

  * ID Mapping is not applied to get* API calls. Data is only returned for underlying symbols, even when `IDMapping` is set on get* API calls. Requests for ID Mapped symbols do not return any results. 
  * When holiday calendars are applied in get* API calls using `applyHolidayCalendar`, the call always returns an empty result.
