# Variadic Function Definitions

As part of a move to improve the ease of use of machine learning functionality
within the KX libraries, various sections of the [ML Toolkit](../toolkit),
along with newly added functionality, have been rewritten using an
experimental variadic function definition API. This change to function
signatures is intended to reduce the barrier to entry for users who are new to
machine learning and wish to make use of the provided ML functionality using
specified default parameters.

By way of definition, a variadic function is one that takes a variable number
of parameters based on the desired operation of the function in question.
Within the context of the ML Analytics library this means that a function is
expected to:

  1. Take a set number of required parameters based on the model i.e. features and target for supervised models or just features for unsupervised models.
  2. Have optional additional parameters defined based on a users desire to tune the performance and expected behavior of a model.

## Sections

An introduction to variadic function calls can be found [here](function-
calls.html) with an explanation of different applications broken into the
following sub-sections:

  1. [Clustering models](clust.html)
  2. [Online models](online.html)
  3. [Time Series models](timeseries.html)
  4. [Statistical models](stats.html)

Note

This functionality is part of an experimental API intended to provide an entry
point to machine learning and kdb+/q for new developers.
