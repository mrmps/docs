# KX Order Book Building for ICE® Data Accelerator Overview

## Introduction

The ICE Order Book Building Accelerator constructs order books from ICE® (The
Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.®) Realtime L2 market data and persists them in
kdb Insights Enterprise. Order Book data can be streamed directly into custom
Realtime streaming analytic pipelines, queried using SQL, or analyzed using
enhanced Accelerator APIs via Python or any downstream application using REST.

The entire Accelerator can be configured and launched on an existing kdb IE
installation in minutes. Quants, business users, and developers can get
instant access to high quality ICE data, paired with the power and performance
of kdb Insights Enterprise, all without a lengthy implementation project.
