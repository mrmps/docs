# Introduction

The _KX ML Analytics Library_ acts as a centralized location for all machine
learning analytics produced by KX. This is an expansion of the KX [ML
Toolkit](https://github.com/kxsystems/ml) and is intended to provide users
with a package which can be integrated into the kdb Insights Enterprise and
Microservices.

The analytics described here cover the following areas:

  1. Data preprocessing
  2. Machine learning models
  3. Model/function optimization
  4. Model evaluation

## Functionality breakdown

Functionality present in the ML Toolkit has been included within the ML
Analytics package described here. The functionality includes, but is not
limited to:

  * Preprocessing functions
  * Clustering models
  * Time-series models

Documentation can be found at [code.kx.com](https://code.kx.com/q/ml/toolkit/)
and should be used in conjunction with the additional documentation found
within this package.

### ML Analytics

In addition to the ML Toolkit functionality, ML Analytics contains the
following:

  * Online learning/out-of-core algorithms
  * Variadic function signatures

## Sections

Documentation follows the structure below:

## Note

The following section has been omitted in the move from the ML Toolkit to ML
Analytics:

This section has been omitted due to potential conflation between the concept
of a pipeline as it pertains to the Stream Processor and graph use within the
ML Toolkit.
